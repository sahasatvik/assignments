## Groups, Rings and Fields
A *binary operation* $f$ on a set $S$ is a mapping $f\colon S\times S \to S$.

A group $G$ is a set with a binary operation $*$ which satisfies the following axioms.

- **Associativity**: $a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c$ for all $a, b, c \in G$.
- **Identity**: There exists an element $i_G \in G$ such that $a * i_G = a$ for all $a \in G$.
- **Inverse**: For every $a \in G$, there exists $b \in G$ such that $a * b = i_G$.

A structure $(G, *)$ which only satisfies *associativity* is called a *semigroup*. A semigroup with an *identity* element is called a *monoid*.

An *abelian group* also satisfies the axiom of *commutativity*.

- **Commutativity**: $a * b = b * a$ for all $a, b \in G$.

A *ring* is a set $R$ with two binary operations $+$ and $\times$ (addition and multiplication) such that $(R, +)$ is an abelian group, $(R, \times)$ is a monoid and $\times$ is distributive over $+$.

- **Distributivity**: $a \times (b + c) = (a \times b) + (a \times c)$ and $(b + c) \times a = (b \times a) + (c \times a)$ for all $a, b, c \in R$.

The additive and multiplicative identities of $R$ are denoted by $0_R$ and $1_R$ respectively.

If $\times$ is commutative, $(R, +, \times)$ is called a *commutative ring*.

A *field* $F$ is a commutative ring such that the non-zero elements form an abelian group under multiplication.

An *ordered field* $F$ is also an ordered set such that for all $a, b, c \in F$,

- If $a > b$, then $a + c > b + c$.
- If $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, then $ab > 0$.

## Real Numbers
The real numbers are a *complete, ordered field*.

### Constructing $\sqrt{2}$

The irrational number $\sqrt{2}$ can be approximated by the rationals with arbitrary precision. This is done iteratively, using the *AM-GM-HM* inequality to generate sequences of rationals converging to $\sqrt{2}$.
We define the sequences
$\{u_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ and $\{l_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ as follows.
$$ u_0 = 2, \quad\quad l_0 = 1. $$
$$ u_{n+1} = \frac{u_n + l_n}{2}, \quad\quad l_{n+1} = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{u_n} + \frac{1}{l_n}}. $$

Note that $u_{n+1}l_{n+1} = u_nl_n$, so $u_nl_n = 2$. Thus, $u_{n+1} > \sqrt{2} > l_{n+1}$ by $AM > GM > HM$. Also, $u_{n+1} < u_n$ and $l_{n+1} > l_n$, so by iterating successively over $n$, we construct the sequence of rational numbers
$$ u_0 > u_1 > \dots > u_n > u_{n+1} > \sqrt{2} > l_{n+1} > l_n > \dots > l_1 > l_0. $$

To put strict bounds on our approximation, we calculate the difference $R_{n+1} = u_{n+1} - l_{n+1}$.
$$ R_{n+1} = u_{n+1} - l_{n+1} = \frac{u_n + l_n}{2} - \frac{2u_nl_n}{u_n + l_n} = \frac{(u_n - l_n)^2}{2(u_n + l_n)}.$$

Since $u_n + l_n > 2l_0 = 2$, we have $R_{n+1} < R_{n}^2 / 4$. Also, $u_n - l_n < u_0 - l_0 = 1$, so $R_{n + 1}/R_{n} < 1/4$. Thus, $R_n \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$, so we can approximate $\sqrt{2}$ with arbitrary precision.
Indeed, after $n$ iterations of this algorithm, the error is at most $1/4^n$.

### Properties of real numbers

These two properties follow from the fact that $\R$ is an *ordered set*.

- **Trichotomy**: Exactly one of the following is true for all $x, y \in \R$: $x < y$, $x = y$, $x > y$.
- **Transitivity**: If $a > b$ and $b > c$, then $a > c$ for all $a, b, c \in \R$.

The real numbers are also *complete*, *i.e.*, $\R$ has the *least upper bound* property.

- **Least Upper Bound**: An ordered set $S$ has the least upper bound property if $\sup E$ exists for every non-empty subset $E \subseteq S$ which is bounded above.
- **Greatest Lower Bound**: An ordered set $S$ has the greatest lower bound property if $\inf E$ exists for every non-empty subset $E \subseteq S$ which is bounded below.

These two properties are equivalent. Let $S$ have the least upper bound property, and let $E \subseteq S$ be bounded below. Let $L$ be the set of all lower bounds of $L$. Then $L \neq \emptyset$, and every element of $E$ is an upper bound of $L$. Also, from the least upper bound property of $S$, $\sup L$ must exist in $S$.
Note that for all $s \in S$, if $s < \sup L$, then there exists $l \in L, l > s$ so $s$ is not an upper bound of $L$, hence $s \notin E$.
The contrapositive of this is that for every $s \in E$, we must have $s \geq \sup L$. This means that $\sup L$ is a lower bound of $E$, so $\sup L \in L$.
Also, $\sup L$ is an upper bound of $L$, so $y \leq \sup L$ for all $y \in L$.
This means that $\sup L \geq y$ for all lower bounds $y\in L$ of $E$.
Thus, $\inf E = \sup L$ for all non-empty $E \subseteq S$ bounded below, so $S$ also has the greatest lower bound property. 
The converse follows similarly.

Note that $\R$ contains $\Q$ as a subfield. The rationals $\Q$ do *not*
have the least upper bound property. For example, the set $\{x\in\Q: x^2 < 2\}$ may have upper bounds in $\Q$, but has no *least* upper bound in $\Q$.

- **$\Z$ is unbounded in $\R$**: To prove this, assume to the contrary that $\Z$ in bounded in $\R$. Then, $\Z$ has a supremum in $\R$, say $\alpha = \sup \Z$. Now, $\alpha - 1/2$ is not an upper bound of $\Z$, so there exists $n \in Z$ such that $\alpha - 1/2 \le n$. This means that $\alpha < n + 1 \in \Z$, which is a contradiction.
- **Archimedean property**: For all $x, y \in R$, $x \neq 0$, there exists $n \in \N$ such that $nx > y$. Note that if this was false, then $y/x$ would be an upper bound of $\Z$, which is a contradiction.
- **$\Q$ is dense in $\R$**: Between any two distinct real numbers, there exists a rational number. Let $x, y \in \R$ with $x < y$. We find $n \in \Z$ such that $n(y - x) > 1$. Note that $n \neq 0$. We find the smallest integer $m \in \Z$ such that
$nx < m$. Thus, $m - 1 \leq nx < m$. Using $1 + nx < ny$, we have $nx < m \leq 1 + nx < ny$, so $x < m/n < y$ as desired.
- **Existence and Uniqueness of positive $n^\text{th}$ roots**: For every positive integer $n$ and every positive real number $x$, there exists a unique positive real number $y$ such that $y^n = x$.
