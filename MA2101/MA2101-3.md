## Sequences
A *sequence* is a function whose domain is the set of natural numbers.
The values of the function are called terms of the sequence.
$$ \alpha\colon\N \to S,\quad n \mapsto \alpha_n.$$
We denote $\alpha_n = \alpha(n)$, and denote the whole sequence as $\{\alpha_n\}$ or $(\alpha_n)_{n \in \N}$.

If the image of $\alpha$ is bounded below or above, we say that the sequence is *bounded* below or above. If the sequence is bounded both below and above, then we say that the sequence is *bounded*.

A sequence $\{\alpha_n\}$ in a metric space $(M, d)$ is said to *converge* to a point $p \in M$, written $\alpha_n \to p$, if for every $r > 0$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that for all $n \geq N$, we have $\alpha_n \in B_r(p)$.

Note that a sequence converges to a point $p$ *iff* $p$ is a limit point of the set $\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots\}$. We write
$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \alpha_n = p. $$

Also note that if $\alpha_n \to p$ in $M$, then the sequence $d(\alpha_n, p) \to 0$ in $\R$.

A *divergent* sequence is one which does not converge.

If $\alpha_n \to a$ and $\alpha_n \to b$ in a metric space $(M, d)$, then $a = b$.

If $\alpha_n$ converges, then $\alpha_n$ is bounded.

If $\ell$ is a limit point of $S$, then there is a sequence $\{s_n\}$ in $S$ such that $s_n \to \ell$.
