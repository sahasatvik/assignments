## Sequences
A *sequence* is a function whose domain is the set of natural numbers.
The values of the function are called terms of the sequence.
$$ \alpha\colon\N \to S,\quad n \mapsto \alpha_n.$$
We denote $\alpha_n = \alpha(n)$, and denote the whole sequence as $\{\alpha_n\}$ or $(\alpha_n)_{n \in \N}$.

If the image of $\alpha$ is bounded below or above, we say that the sequence is *bounded* below or above. If the sequence is bounded both below and above, then we say that the sequence is *bounded*.

A sequence $\{\alpha_n\}$ in a metric space $(M, d)$ is said to *converge* to a point $p \in M$, written $\alpha_n \to p$, if for every $r > 0$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that for all $n \geq N$, we have $\alpha_n \in B_r(p)$.

Note that a sequence converges to a point $p$ *iff* $p$ is a limit point of the set $\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots\}$. We write
$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \alpha_n = p. $$

Also note that if $\alpha_n \to p$ in $M$, then the sequence $d(\alpha_n, p) \to 0$ in $\R$.

A *divergent* sequence is one which does not converge.

If $\alpha_n \to a$ and $\alpha_n \to b$ in a metric space $(M, d)$, then $a = b$.

If $\alpha_n$ converges, then $\alpha_n$ is bounded.

If $\alpha_n \to a$ and $\beta_n \to b$, then $\alpha_n + \beta_n \to a + b$ and $\alpha_n\beta_n \to ab$. Additionally, if $\beta_n \neq 0$ and $b \neq 0$, then $\alpha_n/\beta_n \to a /b$.

If $\ell$ is a limit point of $S$, then there is a sequence $\{s_n\}$ in $S$ such that $s_n \to \ell$.

#### Subsequences

Given a sequence $\{\alpha_n\}$, consider an increasing sequence $n_k$ of positive integers. Then, the sequence $\{\alpha_{n_k}\}$ is called a *subsequence* of $\{\alpha_n\}$. If $\{\alpha_{n_k}\}$ converges, its limit is called the *sub-sequential limit* of $\{\alpha_n\}$.

Let $(M, d)$ be a compact metric space and let $\{\alpha_n\}$ be a sequence in $M$. Then, some subsequence of $\{\alpha_n\}$ converges to a point of $M$.

Every bounded sequence in $\R^n$ has a convergent subsequence.

Let $(M, d)$ be a metric space and let $\{\alpha_n\}$ be a convergent sequence in $M$. Then for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that $d(\alpha_m, \alpha_n) < \epsilon$ if $\min(m, n) \geq N$.

### Cauchy sequences
A sequence $\{\alpha_n\}$ in a metric space $(M, d)$ is called a *Cauchy sequence* if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there is an integer $N \in \N$ such that $d(\alpha_m, \alpha_n) < \epsilon$ if $\min(m, n) \geq N$.

If a subsequence $\{\alpha_{n_k}\}$ of a Cauchy sequence $\{\alpha_n\}$ converges to a limit point $\ell$, then the entire sequence $\{\alpha_n\}$ converges to $\ell$.

A metric space $(M, d)$ is called *Cauchy complete* if every Cauchy sequence in $M$ converges in $M$.

Every compact subset of a metric space is Cauchy complete.

All Euclidean spaces are Cauchy complete.

### Constructing the real numbers
Let $\C$ denote the set of all rational Cauchy sequences. Let $\{\alpha_n\}, \{\beta_n\} \in \C$. We say that the sequences $\{\alpha_n\} \sim \{\beta_n\}$ if $|\alpha_n - \beta_n| \to 0$. It is easily verified that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.

We define $\R$ as the quotient space of this relation, *i.e.*
$$ \R = \C /\sim. $$

The rationals are embedded in the usual way, and addition and multiplication are defined termwise.

The order on $\R$ is defined as follows: $\{\alpha_n\} > \{\beta_n\}$ if there exists $N$ such that $\alpha_n > \beta_n$ for all $n \geq N$, and $|\alpha_n - \beta_n| \not\to 0$.
