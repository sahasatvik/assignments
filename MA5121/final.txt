1. Let dataset on X and Y be

 X: 35, 66, 58, 83, 71
 Y: 46, 56, 60, 49

 Test whether X and Y have the same variability?

2. A group of 20 mice are allocated to individual cages randomly. 
 The cages are randomly assigned to two treatments, a control A
 and a certain drug B. All animals, in a random sequence, are 
 infected with tuberculosis. The numbers of days until the mice 
 die after infection are given as follows
 
 control A: 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 12
 drug B: 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17
 
 Since a priliminary experiment has established that the drug
 is not toxic, we can assume that the drug group cannot be
 worse (die sooner) than the control group. Test the null
 hypothesis that the drug is without effect at a significance 
 level of 0.05 (with a litle justification on your choice of
 test).
