    \section{Problem statement}
    
    Consider the unit disc, \[
        D = \{(x, y) \in \R^2 : x^2 + y^2 \leq 1\},
    \] and the ellipse \[
        D' = \{(x, y) \in \R^2 : 2(x - 1)^2 + 5(y - 2)^2 \leq 8 \}.
    \] The task is to sample some $n$ points from $D$ and $D'$, and thereby estimate
    the value of $\pi$. For reference, \[
        \pi = 3.141592653589793 \dots
    \] 


    \section{Rejection sampling}

    Consider a region $A \subset \R^2$, from which we want to sample points
    uniformly. In other words, we want to simulate the probability density function
    \[
        u_A\colon \R^2 \to \R, \qquad u_A(x, y) = \frac{1}{\mu(A)}\chi_A(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            1 / \mu(A), &\text{ if } (x, y) \in A, \\
            0, &\text{ otherwise}.
        \end{cases}
    \] Here, for $E \subseteq \R^2$, we denote \[
        \mu(E) = \int_E\:dx\:dy,
    \] the `area' or measure of $E$. Now suppose that $A$ is enclosed within a
    rectangle $R = [a, b] \times [c, d]$. We can simulate a uniform distribution on
    $R$ easily enough, by sampling individual coordinates $x \in [a, b]$, $y \in [c,
    d]$ uniformly. This means that we can simulate the probability density function
    \[
        u_R\colon \R^2 \to \R, \qquad u_R(x, y) = \frac{1}{\mu(R)}\chi_R(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            1 / \mu(R), &\text{ if } (x, y) \in R, \\
            0, &\text{ otherwise}.
        \end{cases}
    \] Note that we have normalized \[
        \int_{\R^2} u_A(x, y)\:dx\:dy = \int_{\R^2} u_R(x, y)\:dx\:dy = 1.
    \] Also, $\mu(R) = (b - a)(d - c)$.

    In order to simulate the distribution $u_A$, we propose rejection sampling
    from $u_R$. In other words, draw a point $(x, y) \in R$ using the distribution
    $u_R$. If $(x, y) \in A$, accept this as a sample point; if not, reject it.
    Repeat this process of drawing points from $R$ and checking until we have all $n$
    sample points.

    Consider a point $(X, Y) \in R$ drawn using the distribution $u_R$. We
    compute the probability that it is accepted as follows. \begin{align*}
        P[(X, Y) \text{ accepted}] &= \int_R P[(X, Y)\text{ accepted} \mid X = x, Y =
        y]\, u_R(x, y)\:dx\:dy \\
        &= \int_R \chi_A(x, y)\,u_R(x, y)\:dx\:dy \\
        &= \int_A \frac{1}{\mu(R)}\:dx\:dy \\
        &= \frac{\mu(A)}{\mu(R)}.
    \end{align*}
    The second line follows from the fact that $(X, Y)$ is accepted if and only if
    $(X, Y) \in A$. This result aligns well with our intuition that the probability
    of acceptance ought to be the ratio of areas of $A$ and $R$. If $N$ points are
    drawn from $R$ out of which $n$ were accepted, we approximate \[
        P[(X, Y) \text{ accepted}] = \frac{\mu(A)}{\mu(R)} \approx \frac{n}{N}.
    \]

    Now, we show that points sampled in this way are indeed distributed uniformly
    over $A$, as in $u_A$. Let $E\subseteq A$ be an arbitrary (measurable) region.
    Consider an accepted point $(X, Y) \in A$ in our sample. Using Bayes' Theorem,
    we have \[
        P[(X, Y) \in E \mid (X, Y) \text{ accepted}] = P[(X, Y) \text{ accepted} \mid
        (X, Y) \in E]\cdot \frac{P[(X, Y) \in E]}{P[(X, Y) \text{ accepted}]}.
    \] Note that $(X, Y)$ is always accepted if $(X, Y) \in E$ \subseteq A. Also,
    $(X, Y)$ was chosen uniformly from $R$ using $u_R$, so we can compute much like
    before
    \begin{align*}
        P[(X, Y) \in E] &= \int_R P[(X, Y) \in E\mid X = x, Y = y]\, u_R(x,
        y)\:dx\:dy \\
        &= \int_R \chi_E(x, y)\,u_R(x, y)\:dx\:dy \\
        &= \int_E \frac{1}{\mu(R)}\:dx\:dy \\
        &= \frac{\mu(E)}{\mu(R)}.
    \end{align*}
    Putting things together, \[
        P[(X, Y) \in E \mid (X, Y) \text{ accepted}] = \frac{\mu(E)}{\mu(R)}\cdot
        \frac{\mu(R)}{\mu(A)} = \frac{\mu(E)}{\mu(A)}.
    \] However, this is precisely the defining property of the uniform distribution
    on $A$ described by $u_A$; the probability of a sample point $(X, Y)$ lying
    within an arbitrary region $E \subseteq A$ being proportional to the area of $E$.
    Thus, our sample obtained in this way does indeed follow distribution $u_A$.


    \subsection{The unit disc}

    The unit disc $D$ is enclosed within the square $S = [-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]$.
    Thus, we can calculate the areas $\mu(D) = \pi$, $\mu(S) = 4$. By setting $A =
    D$, $R = S$, we can use the outlined method to draw sample points uniformly from
    $D$. If $n$ samples points are obtained over $N$ draws, we approximate \[
        \frac{\pi}{4} \approx \frac{n}{N}.
    \] 


    \subsection{The ellipse}
    
    By rewriting the defining equation for $D'$ as \[
        \frac{(x - 1)^2}{4} + \frac{(y - 2)^2}{8 / 5} \leq 1,
    \] it is clear that this is an elliptical region centred at $(1, 2)$, with major
    and minor axes parallel to the $x$ and $y$ axes respectively. Furthermore, the
    semi-major and semi-minor axes have lengths $2$ and $\sqrt{8 / 5}$ respectively.

    The ellipse $D'$ is thus enclosed within the square $S' = [-1, 3] \times [0, 4]$.
    We can calculate the areas $\mu(D') = \pi\cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{8 / 5}$, $\mu(S') =
    16$. By setting $A = D'$, $R = S'$, we can use the outlined method to draw sample
    points uniformly from $D'$. If $n$ samples points are obtained over $N$ draws, we
    approximate \[
        \frac{\pi\cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{8 / 5}}{16} = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{40}} \approx
        \frac{n}{N}.
    \] 


    \section{Algorithm}
    
    In summary, here is the algorithm used to sample $n$ points from a region $A
    \subset \R^2$ with uniform distribution $u_A$, where $A$ is enclosed within the
    rectangle $R = [a, b] \times [c, d]$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Select $x_i \in [a, b]$ and $y_i \in [c, d]$ uniformly. In other words,
        select $(x_i, y_i)$ uniformly from the rectangle $R$.
        \item Check whether $(x_i, y_i) \in A$. If so, add the point $(x_i, y_i)$ to
        a pile of accepted points, otherwise add it to a pile of rejected points.
        \item Repeat steps 1, 2 until the accepted pile has $n$ points.
        \item Let the total number of points in the accepted and rejected piles be
        $N$. Then, we have $\mu(A) / \mu(R) \approx n / N$.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item For the unit disc, we use the approximation $\pi \approx 4n/N$.  
            \item For the ellipse, we use the approximation $\pi \approx
            \sqrt{40}n/N$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}



    \section{Program execution}
    
    \subsection{The unit disc}
    
    The above algorithm for the unit disc has been implemented in the python script
    \texttt{sample\_disc.py}, listed in Sec.~\ref{sec:code_listing}. The script also
    plots the data points for better visualisation.
    
    Below is an execution of the script, with $n = 10$ samples drawn from the unit
    disc. Each line (apart from the summary at the end) shows the $x$ and $y$
    coordinate of the data point, along with whether the point was accepted or
    rejected.

    In order to obtain much faster execution speeds, the algorithm for the unit disc
    has also been implemented in the C++ program \texttt{sample\_disc.cpp}, listed in
