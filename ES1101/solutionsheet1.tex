        \problem What is the pressure at the crust-mantle boundary?\\
        \textit{(The rate of change of pressure beneath the earth is $\approx 30 \textnormal{ MPa/km}$. $1 \textnormal{ MPa} = 10 \textnormal{ bar}$)}

        \problem If the focus of an earthquake is at $0^\circ$ from the centre of the Earth, what are the intervals of the shadow zones
        for P and S waves?
        \solution
        The shadow zone intervals for seismic waves are as follows.
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item P waves : $-105^\circ$ to $-142^\circ$ , $+105^\circ$ to $+142^\circ$.
                \item S waves : $-105^\circ$ to $+105^\circ$.
        \end{enumerate}
