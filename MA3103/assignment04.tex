    \problem Prove that the automorphism group of a graph $G$ is equal to the
    automorphism group if its complement $\overline{G}$.

    \solution Let $g \in \aut(G)$ be an automorphism, i.e.\ a permutation of the
    vertices of $G$; we claim that $g \in \aut(\overline{G})$. To see this, pick $x,
    y \in V$ (here, $V$ is the set of vertices, common to $G$ and $\overline{G}$).
    There are two possible cases: \\
    
    \textbf{Case I}: $x \sim y$ in $\overline{G}$. This means that $x \not\sim y$ in
    $G$, hence $g(x) \not\sim g(y)$ in $G$. Thus, $g(x) \sim g(y)$ in $\overline{G}$.

    \textbf{Case II}: $x \not\sim y$ in $\overline{G}$. This means that $x \sim y$ in
    $G$, hence $g(x) \sim g(y)$ in $G$. Thus, $g(x) \not\sim g(y)$ in $\overline{G}$.
    \\

    In either case, $g$ preserves the adjacency relationships between vertices in
    $\overline{G}$. This shows that $\aut(\overline{G}) \subseteq \aut(G)$. Exactly
    the same argument can be repeated, interchanging the roles of $G$ and
    $\overline{G}$; or simply note that $\overline{\overline{G}} = G$ to conclude
    that $\aut(\overline{\overline{G}}) \subseteq \aut(\overline{G}) \subseteq
    \aut{G}$ gives $\aut(G) = \aut(\overline{G})$.


    \problem If $x$ and $y$ are vertices of $X$ and $g \in \aut(X)$, prove that $d(x,
    y) = d(g(x), g(y))$.

    \solution First suppose that $x$ and $y$ are not connected, i.e.\ there is no
    path joining them. If $g(x)$ and $g(y)$ were connected, that would give a path
    $g(x) \sim v_1 \sim \dots \sim v_k \sim g(y)$; now, applying the automorphism
    $g^{-1}$ gives a path $x \sim g^{-1}(v_1) \sim \dots \sim g^{-1}(v_k) \sim y$, a
    contradiction. Thus, $d(x, y) = \infty$ implies that $d(g(x), g(y)) = \infty$.
    Conversely, if $g(x)$ and $g(y)$ are not connected but $x$ and $y$ are via some
    path, applying $g$ to that path yields a path between $g(x)$ and $g(y)$ exactly
    as before. Thus, $d(g(x), g(y)) = \infty$ also implies that $d(x, y) = \infty$.

    Let $d(x, y) = k + 1 < \infty$ (we have $k \geq 0$). This means that there exists
    a path $x \sim v_1 \sim \dots \sim v_k \sim y$. Applying $g$ yields a path $g(x)
    \sim g(v_1) \sim \dots \sim g(v_k) \sim g(y)$, hence $d(g(x), g(y)) \leq d(x,
    y)$. Now if there was a shorter path $g(x) \sim u_1 \sim \dots \sim u_l \sim
    g(y)$, $l < k$ applying $g^{-1}$ would give the shorter path $x \sim g^{-1}(u_1)
    \sim \dots \sim g^{-1}(u_l) \sim y$ between $x$ and $y$, contradicting the
    minimality of $d(x, y) = k + 1$. Thus, $d(x, y) = d(g(x), g(y))$.
    


    \problem Count the number of automorphisms of the Petersen graph.

    \solution The Petersen graph $G$ can be described as follows: let the vertices be
    the two element subsets of $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ (of which there are 10), and
    let two vertices be connected if and only if their intersection is empty.

        \end{center}

        Let $\sigma$ be a permutation of $S$. This defined a corresponding
        permutation of the vertices, sending each vertex $\{x, y\} \to \{\sigma(x),
        \sigma(y)\}$. We claim that this is an automorphism of the graph. To see
        this, pick two vertices $\{x, y\}$, $\{p, q\}$. If they form an edge in $G$,
        that means that $x, y, p, q$ are all distinct elements, hence so are
        $\sigma(x), \sigma(y), \sigma(p), \sigma(q)$ meaning that $\{\sigma(x),
        \sigma(y)\}$, $\{\sigma(p), \sigma(q)\}$ is also an edge. Otherwise, one of
        these elements is repeated, hence applying $\sigma$ keeps them repeated so
        this maps non-edges to non-edges. Thus, we have found as many automorphisms
        of $G$ as there are permutations $\sigma$, i.e.\ $5! = 120$ of them.

        We now show that these are all the automorphisms of $G$. Note that the
        vertex $a \equiv \{1, 2\}$ can be mapped to any other vertex by choosing
        suitable $\sigma$, thus the orbit of $a$ comprises of all 10 vertices. The
        orbit stabilizer theorem thus guarantees that \[
            |\aut(G)| = |H|\cdot 10,
        \] where $H$ is the stabilizer of $a$. Now consider the action of $H$ on the
        graph, specifically on the vertex $c \equiv \{3, 4\}$. The permutation $(45)$
        sends $c \to f$, and $(35)$ sends $c \to d$. There are no other places to
        send $c$, since we must preserve the edge $\{a, c\}$. Thus, the orbit of $c$
        consists of the vertices $c, d, f$, hence \[
            |H| = |K|\cdot 3
        \] where $K$ is the stabilizer of $c$ under the action of $H$. Thus, the
        action of $K$ on the graph fixes both $a$ and $c$. Consider where $K$
        can send the vertex $d$. The permutation $(34)$ sends $d \to f$. There are no
        other places to send $d$, since we must preserve the edge $\{a, d\}$. Thus,
        the orbit of $d$ consists of the vertices $d, f$, hence \[
            |K| = |N|\cdot 2
        \] where $N$ is the stabilizer of $d$ under the action of $K$. Thus, the
        action of $N$ on the graph fixes $a, c, d$, which also means that $f$ must be
        fixed. Consider the action of $N$ on the graph, and examine the vertex $h$.
        The permutation $(12)$ sends $h \to e$, and there are no other places where
        $h$ can be sent. Thus, the orbit of $h$ consists of the vertices $h, e$,
        hence \[
            |N| = |O|\cdot 2,
        \] where $O$ is the stabilizer of $h$ under the action of $N$. Now, the
        action of $O$ on the graph fixes $a, c, d, h$. We claim that this also
        fixes all other elements, i.e.\ $O$ is the trivial group. Indeed, examining
        the neighbours of $c$ show that $a, h$ are fixed so $e$ must also be fixed.
        The vertex $i$ is the only common neighbour of $d$ and $h$, and hence must be
        fixed. Examining the neighbours of $h$ show that $c, i$ are fixed so $g$ must
        also be fixed. Similarly examining the neighbours of $i$ show that $d, h$ are
        fixed so $j$ must also be fixed. This means that the final vertex $f$ is also
        fixed. Thus, $|O| = 1$, hence \[
            |\aut(G)| = 10\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 2 = 120.
        \] 

    
    \problem Find the automorphism group of the following graphs.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \mbox{}
        \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
            \node[main node] (A) {A};
            \node[main node] (B) [right = 1cm of A] {B};
            \node[main node] (C) [right = 1cm of B] {C};
            \node[main node] (D) [right = 1cm of C] {D};

            \path[draw, thick]
            (A) edge (B)
            (B) edge (C)
            (C) edge (D);
        \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}

        \solution We first show that an automorphism must preserve the degree of a
        vertex. Indeed, given a vertex $x \in V(G)$ whose neighbours are $x_1, \dots,
        x_k$ ($k$ being the degree of $x$), if $g$ is an automorphism of the graph
        $G$ then $g(x_1), \dots, g(x_k)$ are all neighbours of $g(x)$; furthermore,
        the remaining vertices $y_1, \dots, y_l$ from $V(G)$ (vertices other than
        $x$, $x_1, \dots, x_k$) are also mapped such that $g(y_1), \dots, g(y_l)$ are
        not neighbours of $g(x)$ by construction of $g$.

        Secondly, an automorphism preserves edges. These two restrictions allow us to
        identify the automorphisms of the given graphs.

        Here, $B$ must be mapped to either $B$ or $C$. If $B \to B$, then $\{A, B\}
        \to \{X, B\}$ forcing $X = A$, hence $A \to A$. This also forces $C \to C$,
        and $D \to D$. Similarly if $B \to C$, then $\{A, B\} \to \{X, C\}$ forcing
        $X = D$, hence $A \to D$. This also forces $C \to B$, and $D \to A$.

        Thus, $\aut(G) \cong C_2$, the group with two elements.

        \solution Note that if $B \to B$, we can have $(A, E) \to (A, E)$ or $(A, E)
        \to (E, A)$, either one independently of $(D, F) \to (D, F)$ or $(D, F) \to
        (F, D)$. (Here, $(X, Y) \to (P, Q)$ is shorthand for $X \to P$ and $Y \to
        Q$). By letting $e$ denote the identity permutation, $l$ denote the swap
        $(AB)$, $r$ denote the swap $(DF)$, and $c$ denote the permutation
        $(BC)(AD)(EF)$, we can see that $\aut(G)$ consists of the following elements:

            e, r, l, rl, c, rc, lc, rlc.
        \] In other words, \[

            C_2\times C_2.

        \solution Like before, $A, B, C$ can be permuted in any way. After this, $E,

        The orbits are \[

        leaving no room for mapping 8. Thus, 5 must remain fixed, 2 must remain
        fixed. 6 and 7 must be mapped amongst themselves; if say 6 is mapped to 1,
        then 8 must be mapped to 4, 7 to 3 which breaks the edge $7 \sim 5$. Thus, 8
        must remain fixed. This in turn fixes 1, 3, 4. Finally, 9 and 10 can be
        mapped amongst themselves. The orbits are \[

    \problem Prove that the $n$-cube is vertex transitive for any $n \in \N$.

    \solution Label the each vertex of the $n$-cube with binary strings of length
    $n$, i.e.\ let each vertex be denoted by $x \equiv x_1x_2 \dots x_n$ where each
    $x_i \in \{0, 1\}$. Two vertices are adjacent if and only if they differ in
    exactly one place, i.e.\ one bit.

    Denote the bit complements $a' = 1 - a$ ($0' = 1$ and $1' = 0$). Define the bit
    flip operations $f_i\colon V \to V$, where $x \mapsto x_1x_2 \dots x_{i -
    1}x_i'x_{i + 1} \dots x_n$. In other words, $f_i$ flips the $i$th bit of each
    vertex. It is clear that this is a bijection: no two vertices can be mapped to
    the same vertex, and every vertex has a pre-image. Indeed, $f_i^2(x) = x$ because
    $a'' = a$ for any bit $a$; this proves both injectivity\footnote{If $f_i(x) =
    f_i(y)$, then $f_i^2(x) = f_i^2(y)$ gives $x = y$.} and surjectivity\footnote{The
    pre-image of $x$ is $f_i(x)$.}. Furthermore, we claim that each $f_i$ is an
    automorphism of the $n$-cube. To see this, pick two vertices $x$ and $y$, and
    suppose that they differ in $k$ bits. Specifically, if $x_i = y_i$, then $x_i' =
    y_i'$; if $x_i \neq y_i$, then $x_i' \neq y_i'$. This shows that $f_i(x)$ and
    $f_i(y)$ still differ in $k$ bits. Thus, $f_i$ preserves the edges of the
    $n$-cube.

    Now, pick an arbitrary vertex $x$. Suppose that the binary string of $x$ has 1's
    in precisely the indices $i_1, i_2, \dots, i_k$. Then, it is clear that
    $f_{i_1}\circ f_{i_2}\circ \dots \circ f_{i_k}(x) = 0$ (the vertex whose binary
    string only consists of 0's). Note that this composition of automorphisms is
    itself an automorphism. Thus, every vertex $x$ contains the common vertex $0$ in
    its orbit, proving that the $n$-cube is vertex transitive.


    \problem If $G$ is a vertex transitive simple connected graph of order $\geq 3$,
    then prove that $G$ does not contain a cut-vertex.

    \solution Note that such a graph is regular (an automorphism preserves the
    degrees of each vertex) with minimum degree $2$. The latter follows because if
    every vertex had degree $1$, then given an edge $\{x, y\}$, there can be no path
    from $x$ to a third vertex $z$: neither $x$ nor $y$ can contribute another edge.     

    First, we claim that an automorphism of $G$ cannot map a non cut-vertex to a
    cut-vertex. Let $x$ not be a cut-vertex, and suppose that $g \in \aut(G)$ is such
    that $g(x)$ is a cut vertex. This means that there exist vertices $y', z'$ such
    that every path between them passes through $g(x)$. Set $y = g^{-1}(y')$, $z =
    g^{-1}(z')$; since $x$ is not a cut vertex, there exists  a path $y, v_1, \dots,
    v_k, z$ not passing through $x$. The image, $y', g(v_1), \dots, g(v_k), z'$ is
    still a path, and none of the $g(v_i) = g(x)$ since that would imply $v_i = x$.
    This contradicts the fact that $g(x)$ is a cut vertex.

    Next, we claim that every connected graph has a non cut-vertex. The lemmas proved
    in Assignment 3 show that every connected graph $G$ has a spanning tree, and
    every tree contains a leaf -- pick such a spanning tree $T$ and a leaf $x$. Now
    pick two vertices $y, z$ from $G$; since $T$ is a spanning tree, there exists a
    path between $y$ and $z$ within the tree $T$ i.e.\ only using edges from $T$.
    Such a path cannot include the vertex $x$: note that $x$ is not an endpoint of
    the path, but $x$ has degree 1 so it cannot be an intermediate vertex in the path
    either. Thus, the removal of $x$ still keeps $T$, hence $G$ connected, which
    means that $x$ is not a cut-vertex.

    The above immediately show that a vertex transitive simple connected graph cannot
    contain a cut-vertex: simply pick a non cut-vertex and note that it can be mapped
    to any other vertex via an automorphism. Thus, none of these vertices can be a
    cut-vertex either.


    \problem Prove that the group action of the automorphism group of a vertex
    transitive graph on the vertex set of the graph can have only one orbit.

    \solution Let $G$ be a vertex transitive graph and let $x \in V(G)$. Then, for
    any $y \in V(G)$, there exists an automorphism $g \in \aut(G)$ such that $gx =
    y$. In other words, $y$ is in the orbit of $x$ for all $y \in V(G)$, so the orbit
    of $x$ is all of $V(G)$. This is true for any $x \in V(G)$, hence there is only
    one orbit.


    \problem Prove that \[
        \chi(G) \geq \frac{|V(G)|}{\alpha(G)}.
    \] 
    
    \solution Let the vertices of $G$ be coloured (in the proper manner) in $k =
    \chi(G)$ colours, and let $V_1, \dots, V_k$ be sets of vertices where $V_i$
    contains vertices of the $i$th colour. This is a partition of the vertices of
    $G$. Furthermore, each $V_i$ is an independent set by construction: no two
    vertices of the same colour are adjacent. Thus, $\alpha(G) \geq |V_i|$ for each
    $i$, giving \[
        k\cdot \alpha(G) \geq \sum_{i = 1}^k |V_i| = |V(G)|
    \] as desired.



    \problem Construct a graph $G$ that is neither a clique nor an odd cycle but has
    a vertex ordering relative to which the greedy colouring uses $\Delta(G) + 1$
    colours.

    \solution Let $G$ be the following graph, with vertices labelled 1,\dots, 6 and
    colours Red, Green, Blue in order.
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
        \node[red node] (1) {1};
        \node[red node] (2) [below = 1cm of 1] {2};
        \node[green node] (3) [right = 1cm of 1] {3};
        \node[green node] (4) [below = 1cm of 3] {4};
        \node[main node] (5) [right = 1cm of 3] {5};
        \node[main node] (6) [below = 1cm of 5] {6};

        \path[draw, thick]

        (5) edge (2)
        (5) edge (4);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    It is easily checked that this is indeed the colouring produced by the greedy
    algorithm; after colouring 1, 2 in red, 3, 4 must be given a new colour and 5, 6
    yet another new colour. Thus, we have used $3 = \Delta(G) + 1$ colours. However,
    it is clear that $\chi(G) = 2$ since it is bipartite.
    
    \problem Prove that a graph $G$ is $2^k$-colourable if and only if $G$ is the
    union of $k$ bipartite graphs.

    \solution First suppose that $G$ is the union of $k$ bipartite graphs, $G_1,
    \dots, G_k$. Let the two parts of each $G_i$ be $A_i$ and $B_i$. Without loss of
    generality, let $V(G) = V(G_i)$ --- do this by adding any remaining vertices not
    in $G_i$ to the part $A_i$, and note that this keeps each $G_i$ bipartite (we
    aren't adding any new edges). Now, given a vertex $x$ in $G$ and an index $i$,
    $x$ is present in exactly one of $A_i$ or $B_i$.  Define $x_i = 1$ if $x \in
    A_i$, and $x_i = 0$ if $x \in B_i$. In this manner, colour each vertex $x \in G$
    with the binary string $x_1x_2 \dots x_k$. There are at most $2^k$ possible
    colours. We now show that this is indeed a proper colouring of $G$. To do this,
    suppose that two vertices $x$ and $y$ have the same colour, i.e.\ their binary
    strings match. For each index $i$, we have $x_i = y_i$; if this is 1, then $x, y
    \in A_i$ and if this is 0, then $x, y \in B_i$. In either case, $x, y$ belong to
    the same part in $G_i$, hence $G_i$ does not contribute the edge $\{x, y\}$.
    However, every edge in $G$ must come from some $G_i$, since it is the union of
    all $G_i$; this proves that $G$ does not contain the edge $\{x, y\}$, hence our
    colouring is proper.

    Next, suppose that $G$ is $2^k$-colourable; like before, label these colours with
    binary strings of length $k$ and colour each vertex with them. For each index $1
    \leq i \leq k$, create the sets $A_i$ and $B_i$. Now given a vertex $x$ in $G$,
    look at the $i$th place in the binary string, i.e.\ the bit $x_i$, and define $x
    \in A_i$, $x \notin B_i$ if $x_i = 1$, otherwise $x \notin A_i$, $x \in B_i$ if
    $x_i = 0$. Finally, construct each $G_i$ by starting with $G$, then removing all
    edges within $A_i$ (that is, removing all edges with both endpoints in $A_i$) and
    removing all edges within $B_i$. Note that each $G_i$ is clearly bipartite by
    construction. We now claim that their union gives all of $G$, i.e.\ every edge in
    $G$ can be found in some $G_i$. Indeed, pick an edge $\{x, y\}$ from $G$; note
    that by our colouring scheme, $x$ and $y$ must have different colours, hence
    their binary strings differ in some index $i$, with $x_i \neq y_i$. Thus, $x_i
    \in A_i$ and $y_i \in B_i$ (without loss of generality), so $G_i$ contains the
    edge $\{x, y\}$ (we have not removed this edge when constructing $G_i$).



    \problem Prove that every graph $G$ has a vertex ordering relative to which the
    greedy colouring uses $\chi(G)$ colours.

    \solution Let $G$ be coloured using $k = \chi(G)$ colours, and let $V_1, \dots,
    V_k$ be the sets of vertices of $G$ such that $V_i$ contains vertices of the
    $i$th colour. Then, each $V_i$ is an independent set. Now, label the vertices of
    each $V_i$ in any order, as $V_i = \{v_{i1}, v_{i2}, \dots, v_{it}\}$. Finally,
    label the vertices of $G$ in order $[V_1, V_2, \dots, V_k]$, i.e.\ $v_{11},
    v_{12}, \dots, v_{1t_1}, v_{21}, v_{22}, \dots, v_{kt_k}$. Here, the vertices
    appear sorted in ascending order of their colour. 

    Now, apply the greedy algorithm. For the first $t_1$ vertices taken from $V_1$,
    all can be assigned the lowest in index colour 1, since there are no conflicts
    ($V_1$ is independent). Next introduce the vertices from $V_2$; here, each vertex
    can be coloured with either 1, 2. There is no need to introduce the colour 3
    since no vertex from $V_2$ is connected to another from $V_2$, which means that
    they are only connected to vertices from $V_1$ coloured in 1. Similarly, at the
    stage when vertices of $V_{j + 1}$ are introduced, the previous vertices all
    being given colours $1,\dots,j$, note that each new vertex can be given a colour
    from $1,\dots,j,j+1$ since they are only connected to vertices from vertices from
    $V_1,\dots,V_j$ coloured in $1,\dots,j$. This shows that the greedy algorithm
    will terminate by using only $k = \chi(G)$ colours.


    \problem Prove that $\chi(G) = \omega(G)$ when $\overline{G}$ is bipartite, where
    $\omega(G)$ is the maximum size of a set of pairwise adjacent vertices (called a
    clique) in $G$.

    \solution Recall that if any subgraph od $G$ has chromatic number $k$, then
    $\chi(G) \geq k$ (otherwise would imply the $< k$ colorability of the subgraph).
    Let $X$ be a largest clique in $G$ of $\omega(G)$ vertices; we have $\chi(G) \geq
    \omega(G)$.
    

    \problem Prove that every $k$-chromatic graph has at least $\binom{k}{2}$ edges.
    Use this to prove that if $G$ is the union of $m$ complete graphs of order $m$,
    then $\chi(G) \leq 1 + m\sqrt{m - 1}$.

    \solution First, let $G$ be $k$-chromatic, and let $V_1, \dots, V_k$ be the
    vertex sets where $V_i$ contains vertices of the $i$th colour. Examine any pair
    $V_i, V_j$, with $i \neq j$. Suppose that there is no edge between them (there is
    no edge with one endpoint in $V_i$, the other in $V_j$). Then, recolouring $V_j$
    to be the same colour as $V_i$ gives us a proper $k - 1$ colouring of $G$,
    contradicting the minimality of $k$. Thus, there must be at least one edge
    associated with each pair $i, j$, of which there are $\binom{k}{2}$.

    Now, let $G$ be the union of $m$ complete graphs of order $m$. Then, $G$ has at
    most $m \cdot \binom{m}{2}$ edges. Set $\chi(G) = k$, hence \[
        m\cdot \binom{m}{2} \geq |E(G)| \geq \binom{k}{2}, \qquad 
        m^2(m - 1) \geq k(k - 1) \geq (k - 1)^2.
    \] Taking a square root, $k - 1 \leq m\sqrt{m - 1}$ or $k \leq 1 + m\sqrt{m - 1}$
    as desired. \\


    \begin{lemma}
        The chromatic polynomial of a graph with two components is the product of the
        chromatic polynomials of those components.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $G_1$, $G_2$ be the two components of $G$. Then, there are no edges
        between them. Given some $k$, there are $P_{G_1}(k)$ ways of colouring $G_1$,
        and for each of these there are $P_{G_2}(k)$ ways of colouring $G_2$. This
        gives a total of $P_{G_1}(k)P_{G_2}(k)$ colourings of $G$. Furthermore, every
        colouring of $G$ can be expressed in this way, i.e.\ every colouring of $G$
        gives a colouring of $G_1$ and a colouring of $G_2$, hence we have accounted
        for all possible $k$-colourings of $G$.
    \end{proof}


    \problem Prove that if $T$ is a tree with $n$ vertices, then $P_T(k) = k(k -
    1)^{n - 1}$.

    \solution We use induction on $n$. This is trivial for $n = 2$, since the tree on
    $2$ vertices clearly shows $P_T(k) = k(k - 1)$. Now, pick a tree $T$ with $n > 2$
    vertices, and suppose that this statement holds for all trees with less than $n$
    vertices. Let $x$ be a leaf of $T$, and let $e = \{x, y\}$ be the only edge of
    $x$. Then, $T' = T / e$ is a tree on $n - 1$ vertices. Furthermore, $T - e$ gives
    the same tree $T'$ along with an extra isolated vertex $x$. Using the relation
    $P_{G} = P_{G - e} - P_{G/e}$ together with Lemma 1 (the chromatic polynomial of
    a single isolated vertex is just $k$), we can write \[
        P_T(k) = k \cdot P_{T'}(k) - P_{T'}(k) = (k - 1)P_{T'}(k) = (k - 1)\cdot k(k
        - 1)^{n - 2} = k(k - 1)^{n - 1}.
    \] 


    \problem Show that the chromatic polynomial $P_G(k)$ has degree $|V(G)|$, with
    integer coefficients alternating in sign and beginning $1, -e(G), \dots, $. Here,
    $e(G)$ is the number of edges in $G$.

    \solution This is easily verified for all graphs $G$ with at most $2$ vertices.
    We proceed by induction on $n$; suppose that this holds for all graphs will fewer
    than $n > 2$ vertices. Pick a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices. If $e(G) = 0$, i.e.\ $G$
    only contains isolated vertices, it is clear that $P_G(k) = k^n$ which is of the
    given form. Otherwise, we perform induction on $e(G)$; suppose that this
    statement holds for all $G$ with $n$ vertices, and fewer than $e(G)$ edges. Pick
    an edge $e$ from $G$, and note that $G - e$ has $n$ vertices, $e(G) - 1$ edges
    while $G/e$ has $n - 1$ vertices. Thus, write their chromatic polynomials as 
    \begin{align*}
        P_{G - e}(k) &= k^n - (e(G) - 1)k^{n - 1} + a_{n - 2}k^{n - 2} + a_{n - 3}k^{n
        - 3} - \dots + (-1)^na_0, \\
        P_{G/e}(k) &= k^{n - 1} - b_{n - 2}k^{n - 2} + b_{n - 3}k^{n - 3} + \dots +
        (-1)^{n - 1}b_0.
    \end{align*}
    Here, all $a_i, b_i \geq 0$. Using $P_{G} = P_{G - e} - P_{G/e}$ gives us \[
        P_G(k) = k^n - e(G)k^{n - 1} + (a_{n - 2} + b_{n - 2})k^{n - 2} - (a_{n - 3}
        + b_{n - 3})k^{n - 3} + \dots + (-1)^n(a_0 + b_0),
    \] which is of the desired form.



    \problem Prove that $k^4 - 4k^3 + 3k^2$ is not a chromatic polynomial.

    \solution Denote this expression as $p(k)$. Note that \[
        p(k) = k^2(k^2- 4k + 3) = k^2(k - 1)(k - 3).
    \] If $p$ was the chromatic polynomial of some graph $G$, this would imply that
    $G$ has $p(3) = 0$ number of 3-colourings, but $p(2) = -4$ number of
    2-colourings, which is absurd.


    \problem Prove that \[
        P_{C_n}(k) = (k - 1)^n + (-1)^n(k - 1).
    \] 

    \solution We show this by induction. This is clearly true for $n = 3$, since
    there are $k\cdot(k - 1)\cdot(k - 2)$ ways of colouring $C_3 = K_3$ with $k$
    colours, and this is just $k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k = (k - 1)^3 - (k - 1)$.

    Now, suppose that this holds for cycles of length less than $n > 3$. Pick an edge
    $e$ from $C_n$, and note that $C_n - e = P_n$, $C_n / e = C_{n - 1}$. Thus, our
    reduction formula gives \[
        P_{C_n}(k) = P_{P_n}(k) - P_{C_{n - 1}}(k) = k(k - 1)^{n - 1} - \left[(k -
        1)^{n - 1} + (-1)^{n - 1}(k - 1)\right].
    \] Simplifying, this gives \[
        P_{C_n}(k) = (k - 1)^{n - 1}(k - 1) - (-1)^{n - 1}(k - 1) = (k - 1)^n +
        (-1)^n(k - 1).
    \] 

    \begin{lemma}
        The chromatic polynomial of any graph has integer coefficients.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Use the induction method of Exercise 16; if all the coefficients of $P_{G -
        e}$ and $P_{G / e}$ are integers, then so are the coefficients of $P_G$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        The chromatic polynomial of any graph can only have integer roots.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        This follows directly from the rational root theorem. Suppose that \[
            P_G(k) = k^t\left[k^{n - t} - mk^{n - t - 1} + \dots + a_1k + a_0\right],
        \] where $a_0 \neq 0$ (if $P_G$ has no such coefficient, then $P_G(k) = k^n$
        and we are done). Then, the roots of the bracketed polynomial must be
        rational numbers $p / q$, $\gcd(p, q) = 1$ such that $p | a_0$ and $q | 1$,
        i.e.\ the roots must be integers. This is also easily seen from the fact that
        if \[
             k^{n - t} - mk^{n - t - 1} + \dots + a_1k + a_0 = 0,
        \] all the powers of $k$ are divisible by $k$, hence $a_0$ must also be
        divisible by $k$.
    \end{proof}


    \problem Prove that the chromatic polynomial of an $n$-vertex graph has no real
    root larger than $n - 1$.

    \solution Note that $\chi(G) \leq n$ for any graph, hence its chromatic
    polynomial $P_G(k)$ is a strictly positive integer for all integers $k \geq n$
    (any $\chi(G)$ colouring gives a valid $k \geq n$ colouring). Thus, $P_G$ has no
    integer roots $k > n - 1$; but $P_G$ can only have integer roots by the above
    lemma, so $P_G$ has no real roots $x > n - 1$.


    \begin{lemma}
        The chromatic polynomial of any graph has no negative roots.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Since the coefficients of $P_G$ have alternating signs, $P_G(k)$ for negative
        $k$ is strictly positive when the degree $n$ is even, and strictly negative
        when the degree $n$ is odd. Hence, there can be no negative roots.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        The roots of a chromatic polynomial must among the integers $0, 1, \dots,
        \chi(G) - 1$.
    \end{lemma}


        
    \problem Prove that the last non-zero term in the chromatic polynomial of $G$ is
    the term whose exponent is the number of components of $G$.

    \solution We will show that when $G$ is connected, the highest power of $k$
    dividing $P_G(k)$ is exactly $k$. This in turn will show that when $G$ has $r$
    components, the highest power of $k$ dividing $P_G(k)$ will be $k^r$ (Lemma 1
    shows that the chromatic polynomials of the components multiply).

    Let $G$ be a connected graph on $n$ vertices. Then it is clear that $P_G(0) = 0$
    since there is no way of colouring $G$ with zero colours, thus $k | P_G(k)$.
    Another way to see this is to note that for any $k \geq \chi(G)$ and given some
    proper $k$-colouring of $G$, cyclically permuting the $k$ colours yields $k$
    distinct proper colourings.  Furthermore, none of these can be obtained by
    cyclically permuting the colours of some other $k$-colouring not present here.
    Thus, the $P_G(k)$ many $k$-colourings can be partitioned into groups of $k$,
    hence $k | P_G(k)$.

    Note that the highest power of $k$ dividing the chromatic polynomial of any
    connected graphs on $2$ vertices is just $k$, as desired. Suppose that this
    result holds for all connected graphs on fewer than $n > 2$ vertices, and let $G$
    be connected with $n$ vertices. If $G$ has $n - 1$ edges, it is a tree so we know
    that $P_G(k) = k(k - 1)^{n - 1}$. Further suppose that the result holds for all
    $G$ on fewer than $n$ vertices, fewer than $e(G) > n - 1$ edges. Since $e(G) > n
    - 1$, it contains a cycle. Then, we can find an edge $e$ whose removal keeps $G$
    connected (there are edges in $G$ apart from those in its spanning tree, choose
    one of these). Now, $G - e$ is connected with fewer than $e(G)$ edges, and $G /
    e$ is connected with fewer than $n$ vertices. Thus, write
    \begin{align*}
        P_{G - e}(k) &= k^n - (e(G) - 1)k^{n - 1} + a_{n - 2}k^{n - 2} + a_{n - 3}k^{n
        - 3} - \dots - (-1)^na_1k, \\
        P_{G/e}(k) &= k^{n - 1} - b_{n - 2}k^{n - 2} + b_{n - 3}k^{n - 3} + \dots -
        (-1)^{n - 1}b_1k.
    \end{align*}
    Here, all $a_i, b_i \geq 0$ and $a_1, b_1 \neq 0$ since $k^2$ does not divide
    either of these polynomials by the induction hypothesis. Subtracting, \[
        P_G(k) = k^n - e(G)k^{n - 1} + (a_{n - 2} + b_{n - 2})k^{n - 2} - (a_{n - 3}
        + b_{n - 3})k^{n - 3} + \dots - (-1)^n(a_1 + b_1)k.
    \] Again, $a_1 + b_1 \neq 0$ hence $k^2$ does not divide $P_G(k)$. This proves the
    result by induction.
