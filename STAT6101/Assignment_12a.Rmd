## Answer 1

(a) Using the discussion in Section 21.2, we estimate the treatment effect as
    $0.5 / 0.7 \approx `r round(0.5/0.7, 2)`$.


(b) We can estimate the average treatment effect among the compliers, i.e.
    those patients whose decision to take the drug can be affected by the
    offer.


## Answer 2

(a) The pre-treatment measurement is used to compute the encouragement effects,
    thereby allowing us to perform our instrumental variable analysis using
    estimated ITT and treatment effects.


(b) I would set up a model of the form $$
        \text{blood pressure}_{\text{post experiment}}
            \sim \text{drug taken}
                + \text{blood pressure}_{\text{pre experiment}}
                + \text{age}.
    $$ We could also throw in an indicator variable for restricting our
    pre-experiment data to near the discontinuity.
