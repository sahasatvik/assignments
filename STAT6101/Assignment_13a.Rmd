## Answer 1

(a) We can reasonably assume that an issue attitude of $5$ (the midpoint of the
    $0$-$10$ scale) corresponds to a predicted probability of $1/2$ for voting
    for the conservative party.
    This suggests that $a = -1$ (solving for $a + 0.2(5) = 0$).

(b) Given our fitted model $$
        y = 0.1 + 0.2x + (0.3 + 0.4x) z + \text{error},
    $$ we would estimate the population average causal effect as $0.3
    + 0.4\bar{x}$, where $\bar{x}$ is the population average pre-treatment
    measurement.
