    \begin{abstract}
        We study the double torus, a compact orientable manifold $\Sigma_2$ of genus
        $2$, and its universal cover. In particular, we examine the upper half plane
        $\mathbb{H}^2$ and the Poincar\'e disc $\mathbb{D}^2$ models of the
        hyperbolic plane. We use this to compute the fundamental group of $\Sigma_2$
        and discuss its relationship with the group of deck transformations on
        $\mathbb{D}^2$. We further note that this covering space induces a metric of
        constant negative Gaussian curvature on $\Sigma_2$.
    \end{abstract}

    \section{Introduction}

    The double torus is our primary object of study. It can be described as a
    topological manifold, obtained from the connected sum of two tori. In other
    words, take two tori, remove a small open disc from both, then glue them together
    along their new boundaries. The result is a compact manifold of genus 2, which we
    refer to as $\Sigma_2$. The process of taking connected sums of tori can be
    repeated, with $n$ contributing tori yielding a compact manifold $\Sigma_g$ of
    genus $g$.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tori.png}
        \end{center}
        \caption{The torus and the double torus, representing the structures
        $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$.}
        \label{fig:tori}
    \end{figure}

    The manifold $\Sigma_2$ has many possible embeddings in the real space $\R^3$,
    and each of these induces a differential structure, hence a notion of curvature
    on the surface. In Figure.~1, we see that this representation of $\Sigma_2$ has
    regions of positive curvature where the surface bulges outwards, and regions of
    negative curvature where it caves inwards. 


    \begin{theorem}
        If $\Sigma \subseteq \R^3$ is a compact surface, then there exists a point $p
        \in \Sigma$ where the Gaussian curvature $K(p) > 0$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Consider the map \[
            f\colon \Sigma \to \R, \qquad v \mapsto \Vert v\Vert^2.
        \] From the compactness of $\Sigma$, this must attain a maximum and minimum
        at some points $p_+, p_- \in \Sigma$. At such points, we have $Df_p\equiv 0$,
        but \[
            Df_p\colon T_p\Sigma \to T_{f(p)}\R, \qquad v \mapsto 2\langle p,
            v\rangle.
        \] Thus, we must have $p_{\pm} \perp T_{p_\pm}\Sigma$. Now, pick a regular
        curve $\gamma$ in $\Sigma$ based at $p_+$. Then $f\circ \gamma$ must attain
        its maximum at $0$, hence \[
            \frac{d}{dt}f(\gamma(t))\Big|_{t = 0} = 0, \qquad
            \frac{d^2}{dt^2}f(\gamma(t))\Big|_{t = 0} \leq 0.
        \] This means that \[
            2\langle \gamma(0), \dot{\gamma}(0)\rangle = 0, \qquad
            2[\Vert \dot{\gamma}(0) \Vert^2 + \langle \gamma(0),
            \ddot{\gamma}(0)\rangle] \leq 0.
        \] By construction, $\Vert \dot{\gamma}\Vert = 1$, $\gamma(0) = p_+$, and
        $\Vert \ddot{\gamma}(0)\Vert$ is the curvature $\kappa$. The latter
        inequality gives $\kappa \geq 1 / \Vert p_+ \Vert$. Since this is true for
        any such $\gamma$, this must also hold for the principal curvatures $k_1,
        k_2$, hence the Gaussian curvature $K(p_+) = k_1k_2 \geq 1 / \Vert
        p_+\Vert^2$.
    \end{proof}


    However, it is not necessary that all possible structures on $\Sigma_2$ can be
    faithfully represented in $\R^3$. Here, we show that it is possible to assign a
    constant negative curvature structure to $\Sigma_2$, by making use of
    its universal cover.

    In the rest of this section, we run through three models of the torus $\Sigma_1$,
    which will be analogous to our final construction of $\Sigma_2$. We also list a
    few basic results regarding fundamental groups and covering spaces. Next, we give
    a very brief description of the hyperbolic plane, specifically the upper half
    plane and Poincar\'e disc models. Following that, we take a close look at the
    relationship between a discontinuous group acting on a space and its fundamental
    domain. There, we exhibit a classical theorem of Poincar\'e which determines when
    certain polygons with identified sides can be expressed as a fundamental polygon
    of a group action, and how to reconstruct that group using the identifications on
    the sides. Finally, we use these tools to construct our model of $\Sigma_2$ by
    starting with such a polygon in the Poincar\'e disc $\mathbb{D}^2$, and showing
    that it is indeed the fundamental polygon of a group of isometries of
    $\mathbb{D}^2$. Thus, $\Sigma_2$ can be expressed as a quotient of its universal
    cover $\mathbb{D}^2$, giving it the negative curvature structure we seek.


    \subsection{The torus}

    We use the torus $\Sigma_1$ as a motivating example. One manifestation of this
    manifold involves its embedding as the surface $T_{a, b}$ in $\R^3$, using the
    charts \[
        \sigma_+\colon (0, 2\pi)\times (0, 2\pi) \to T_{a, b}, \qquad
        (u, v) \mapsto (+(a + b\cos{u})\cos{v}, (a + b\cos{u})\sin{v}, b\sin{u})
    \] \[
        \sigma_-\colon (0, 2\pi)\times (0, 2\pi) \to T_{a, b}, \qquad
        (u, v) \mapsto (-(a - b\cos{u})\cos{v}, (a - b\cos{u})\sin{v}, b\sin{u})
    \]

    It can be shown that the First and Second Fundamental Forms of $T_{a, b}$ at some point
    $p = \sigma_+(u, v)$ are given by \[
        \operatorname{I}^{\sigma_+}_p = b^2\:du^2 + (a + b\cos{u})^2\:dv^2, \qquad
        \operatorname{I\!I}^{\sigma_+}_p = b\:du^2 + (a + b\cos{u})\cos{u}\:dv^2.
    \] Thus, the principal curvatures at $p$ are given by \[
        k_1 = \frac{1}{b}, \qquad k_2 = \frac{\cos{u}}{a + b\cos{u}}.
    \] Their product gives the Gaussian curvature, \[
        K = \frac{\cos{u}}{b(a + b\cos{u})}.
    \] This is positive precisely when $u \in (0, \pi / 2) \cup (3\pi / 2, 2\pi)$,
    and negative when $u \in (\pi / 2, 3\pi / 2)$.


    Another construction of $\Sigma_1$ involves starting with a unit square $I^2 =
    [0, 1] \times [0, 1]$, then identifying the sides via the relation described by
    $(x, 0) \sim (x, 1)$, $(0, y) \sim (1, y)$, along with their symmetric
    counterparts. The resultant space $I^2 / \sim$ is homeomorphic to $T_{a, b}$, but
    the differential structure it inherits from $I^2 \subset \R^2$ is very different.
    Indeed, this manifestation of $\Sigma_1$ is completely flat, with constant
    Gaussian curvature of zero everywhere.


    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/torus_cut.png}
        \end{center}
        \caption{Cutting the torus along the red and blue lines yields the unit
        square with the marked identifications at the sides.}
        \label{fig:torus_cut}
    \end{figure}


    A third construction of $\Sigma_1$ starts with the plane $\R^2$, with the group
    $\Z^2$ acting on it via translations. In other words, $(m, n)\in \Z^2$ sends the
    point $(x, y)$ to $(x + m, y + n)$. Identifying orbits together, the quotient
    space $\R^2 / \Z^2$ is again homeomorphic to $T_{a, b}$. This formulation is
    almost identical to the one with $I^2 / \sim$. We will later see that $\R^2$ acts
    as a universal cover of $\Sigma_1$, with the group of deck transformations
    $\Z^2$. The unit square $I^2$ is a fundamental polygon of this action of $\Z^2$
    on $\R^2$.


    \subsection{Fundamental groups}

    The following definitions and results have been paraphrased from \emph{Hatcher}
    \cite{hatcher}.

    Given a space $X$ and a point $x_0 \in X$, a path from $x_0$ to $x_1$ is a
    continuous map $\gamma\colon [0, 1] \to X$ such that $\gamma(0) = x_0$,
    $\gamma(1) = x_1$. If $\gamma(1) = \gamma(0) = x_0$, we call this a loop with
    basepoint $x_0$. Two paths $\gamma, \eta$ where $\gamma(1) = \eta(0)$ can be
    concatenated forming a new path $\gamma * \eta$, as follows. \[
        \gamma * \eta\colon [0, 1] \to X, \qquad
        t \mapsto \begin{cases}
            \gamma(2t), &\text{ if } 0 \leq t < 1 / 2, \\
            \eta(2t - 1), &\text{ if } 1 / 2 \leq t \leq 1.
        \end{cases}
    \]

    Furthermore, a curve $\gamma$ can be reversed, forming \[
        \overline{\gamma}\colon [0, 1] \to X, \qquad
        t \mapsto \gamma(1 - t).
    \]

    Two paths $\gamma, \eta$ with the same endpoints are said to be homotopic if
    there exists a continuous map $f\colon [0, 1] \times [0, 1] \to X$ such that
    $f(t, 0) = \gamma(t)$, $f(t, 1) = f_1(t) = \eta(t)$ for all $t \in [0, 1]$, and
    $f(0, s) = \gamma(0) = \eta(0)$, $f(1, s) = \gamma(1) = \eta(1)$ for all $s \in
    [0, 1]$. In other words, $f$ is a homotopy between $\gamma$ and $\eta$, relative
    to the endpoints $x_0, x_1$. \\

    \begin{lemma}
        Homotopy describes an equivalence relation between paths with fixed endpoints.
    \end{lemma}

    We denote $[\gamma]$ to be the equivalence class of a path $\gamma$ under
    homotopy, i.e.\ the set of all paths homotopic to $\gamma$. This is also called
    the homotopy class of $\gamma$.

    Consider the set $\Omega(X, x_0)$ of all loops in $X$ based at $x_0 \in X$, and
    quotient this via homotopy equivalence. The resulting space, denoted $\pi_1(X,
    x_0)$, forms a group, with the group operation and inverse described as follows:
    given $[\gamma], [\eta] \in \pi_1(X, x_0)$, define \[
        [\gamma] \cdot [\eta] = [\gamma * \eta], \qquad
        [\gamma]^{-1} = [\overline{\gamma}].
    \]

    \begin{lemma}
        The space $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ comprised of homotopy classes of loops based at
        $x_0$ is a group.
    \end{lemma}

    Suppose that $x_0, x_1 \in X$ are joined via a path $\alpha\colon [0, 1] \to X$,
    with $\alpha(0) = x_0$ and $\alpha(1) = x_1$. Then, each curve $\gamma \in
    \Omega(X, x_0)$ can be associated with the curve $(\overline{\alpha} * \gamma) *
    \alpha \in \Omega(X, x_1)$. Note that the latter is \emph{not} the same curve as
    $\overline{\alpha} * (\gamma * \alpha)$, but is homotopic to it via
    reparametrization. Thus, the homotopy class denoted $[\overline{\alpha} * \gamma
    * \alpha]$ is unambiguous. Note that if $\gamma_1, \gamma_2 \in [\gamma]$, then
    $(\overline{\alpha} * \gamma_1) * \alpha$ and $(\overline{\alpha} * \gamma_2) *
    \alpha$ are homotopic. This means that the association of homotopy classes
    $[\gamma]$ with $[\overline{\alpha} * \gamma * \alpha]$ is well-defined. \\

    \begin{lemma}
        Let $\alpha$ be a path from $x_0 \in X$ to $x_1 \in X$. The map \[
            \Phi\colon \pi_1(X, x_0) \to \pi_1(X, x_1), \qquad
            [\gamma] \mapsto [\overline{\alpha} * \gamma * \alpha],
        \] is a group isomorphism.
    \end{lemma}

    As a result, if $X$ is path connected, we may simply speak of \emph{the}
    fundamental group $\pi_1(X)$ of the space $X$.

    We say that the space $X$ is simply connected if $X$ is path connected, and
    $\pi_1(X)$ is the trivial group.

    \begin{example}
        Given any two loops $\gamma, \eta$ in $\R^n$ with basepoint $x_0$, the linear
        interpolation $(t, s) \mapsto (1 - s)\gamma(t) + s\eta(t)$ is a homotopy.
        Thus, $\R^n$ is simply connected, with $\pi_1(\R^n) = 0$.
    \end{example}

    \begin{lemma}
        A space $X$ is simply connected if and only if there exists a unique homotopy
        class of paths between any two points in $X$.
    \end{lemma}

    One basic but important calculation is the fundamental group of the circle $S^1$.
    \\

    \begin{theorem}
        The fundamental group of the unit circle $S^1$ is isomorphic to the infinite
        cyclic group $\Z$, via the isomorphism \[
            \Phi\colon \Z \to \pi_1(S^1), \qquad
            n \mapsto [\omega_n], \qquad
            \omega_n(t) = e^{2\pi i nt}.
        \]
    \end{theorem}

    If $f\colon X \to Y$ is a continuous map such that $f(x_0) = y_0$, it induces a
    map sending loops $\gamma \in \Omega(X, x_0)$ to loops $f\circ
    \gamma \in \Omega(Y, y_0)$. Again, if $\gamma_1, \gamma_2 \in [\gamma]$, then
    $f\circ \gamma_1$ and $f\circ \gamma_2$ are homotopic, making the map sending
    $[\gamma]$ to $[f\circ \gamma]$ well-defined. \\

    \begin{lemma}
        Let $f\colon (X, x_0) \to (Y, y_0)$ be continuous. The induced map \[
            f_*\colon \pi_1(X, x_0) \to \pi_1(Y, y_0), \qquad
            [\gamma] \mapsto [f\circ \gamma]
        \] is a group homomorphism.
    \end{lemma}

    Note that if $f\colon (X, x_0) \to (Y, y_0)$ and $g\colon (Y, y_0) \to (Z, z_0)$
    are continuous, then we have $(g\circ f)_* = g_*\circ f_*$. \\

    \begin{corollary}
        Let $f\colon (X, x_0) \to (Y, y_0)$ be a homeomorphism. The induced map
        $f_*\colon \pi_1(X, x_0) \to \pi_1(Y, y_0)$ is a group isomorphism.
    \end{corollary}

    If $A \subseteq X$, then a retraction from $X$ onto $A$ is a map $f\colon X \to
    A$ such that $f$ fixes $A$. Furthermore, a deformation retraction is a continuous
    map $f\colon X \times [0, 1] \to X$ such that $f(\cdot, 0) = f_0$ is the identity
    map on $X$, $f_1(\cdot, 0) = f_1$ is a retraction from $X$ onto $A$, and each
    $f(\cdot, t) = f_t$ fixes $A$. In other words, it is a homotopy between the
    identity map on $A$ and the retraction $f_1$, relative to $A$. \\

    \begin{lemma}
        If $X$ retracts onto $A \subseteq X$, then the group homomorphism $i_*\colon
        \pi_1(A, x_0) \to \pi_1(X, x_0)$ for $x_0 \in A$, induced by the inclusion
        $i\colon A \hookrightarrow X$ is injective. Furthermore, if $A$ is a
        deformation retract of $X$, then $i_*$ is a group isomorphism.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{example}
        Any convex set $K$ in a metric space deformation retracts to a point $x_0 \in
        K$, via the homotopy $(x, t) \mapsto x + (x_0 - x)t$. Thus, we trivially have
        $\pi_1(K) = 0$. This immediately shows that all $\pi_1(\R^n) = 0$.
    \end{example}



    \subsection{Covering spaces}

    The following definitions and results have been paraphrased from \emph{Hatcher}
    \cite{hatcher}.

    Consider a topological space $X$. A covering space of $X$ consists of a space
    $\tilde{X}$ and a continuous map $p\colon \tilde{X} \to X$ such that there exists
    an open cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ of $X$ where each $p^{-1}(U_\alpha)$ is a disjoint
    union of open subsets of $\tilde{X}$. Furthermore, the restriction of $p$ to each
    of these open subsets is a homeomorphism onto $U_\alpha$.

    \begin{example}
        The unit circle $S^1$ has a covering space $\R$, with \[
            p\colon \R \to S^1, \qquad t \mapsto e^{2\pi i t}.
        \] Note that the pre-image of a sufficiently small open neighbourhood of some
        point $e^{2\pi i t} \in S^1$ consists of infinitely many shifted copies of
        the same open set in $\R$.
    \end{example}

    Let $f\colon Y \to X$ be a continuous map, and suppose that $X$ has a covering
    space $p\colon \tilde{X} \to X$. Then, a map $\tilde{f}\colon Y \to \tilde{X}$
    satisfying $p\circ \tilde{f} = f$ is called a lift of $f$. \\

    \begin{lemma}[Homotopy lifting]
        Let $p\colon \tilde{X} \to X$ be a covering space. Suppose that $f\colon Y
        \times [0, 1] \to X$ is a homotopy with $f(\cdot, 0) = f_0$, and let
        $\tilde{f_0}$ be a lift of $f_0$. Then, there exists a unique homotopy
        $\tilde{f}\colon Y \times [0, 1] \to \tilde{X}$ of $\tilde{f_0}$ that lifts
        $f$.
    \end{lemma}

    Note that when $Y = \{x_0\}$ is a single point, this says given a path
    $\gamma\colon [0, 1] \to X$ with $\gamma(0) = x_0$ and given $\tilde{x}_0 \in
    p^{-1}(x_0)$, there exists a unique path $\tilde{\gamma}$ lifting $\gamma$ with
    $\tilde{\gamma}(0) = \tilde{x}_0$. \\


    \begin{lemma}
        Let $p\colon (\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0) \to (X, x_0)$ be a covering space. The
        induced map \[
            p_*\colon \pi_1(\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0) \to \pi_1(X, x_0), \qquad
            [\gamma] \mapsto [p\circ \gamma]
        \] is an injective group homomorphism. Furthermore, the image subgroup
        $p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0))$ in $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ consists of homotopy
        classes of loops in $X$ based at $x_0$ whose lifts to $\tilde{X}$ starting at
        $\tilde{x}_0$ are loops.
    \end{lemma}

    We can also lift certain types of general maps. \\

    \begin{lemma}[Lifting criterion]
        Let $p\colon (\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0) \to (X, X_0)$ be a covering space and
        let $f\colon (Y, y_0) \to (X, x_0)$ be continuous. Furthermore, let $Y$ be
        path connected at locally path-connected. Then, there exists a lift
        $\tilde{f}\colon (Y, y_0) \to (\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0)$ if and only if
        $f_*(\pi_1(\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0)) \subset p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{X},
        \tilde{x}_0))$.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{lemma}[Unique lifting]
        Let $p\colon \tilde{X} \to X$ be a covering space and let $f\colon Y \to X$
        be continuous, with two lifts $\tilde{f}_1, \tilde{f}_2\colon Y \to
        \tilde{X}$. If $Y$ is connected and $\tilde{f}_1, \tilde{f}_2$ agree on at
        least one point of $Y$, then they must agree on all of $Y$.
    \end{lemma}

    Consider two covering space $p_1\colon \tilde{X}_1 \to X$, $p_2\colon \tilde{X}_2
    \to X$ of $X$. An isomorphism between them consists of homeomorphism $f\colon
    \tilde{X}_1 \to \tilde{X}_2$, such that $p_1 = p_2\circ f$. \\

    \begin{theorem}
        A simply connected covering space of a path connected, locally path connected
        space $X$ is a covering space of every other path connected covering space of
        $X$.
    \end{theorem}

    Such a simply connected covering space of $X$ is called a universal cover. 

    If $p\colon \tilde{X} \to X$ is a covering space, the isomorphisms $\tilde{X} \to
    \tilde{X}$ form a group $G(\tilde{X})$ under composition, called the group of
    deck transformations of $\tilde{X}$. We say that a covering space is normal if
    given any pair of lifts $\tilde{x}_1, \tilde{x}_2$ of $x \in X$, there exists a
    deck transformation sending $\tilde{x}_1$ to $\tilde{x}_2$.


    \begin{theorem}
        Let $p\colon (\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0) \to (X, x_0)$ be a path connected
        covering space of the path connected, locally path connected space $X$, and
        let $H$ be the subgroup $p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0)) \subset \pi_1(X,
        x_0)$. Then, \begin{enumerate}
            \item This covering space is normal if and only if $H$ is a normal
            subgroup.
            \item The group of deck transformations $G(\tilde{X})$ is isomorphic to
            $N(H) / H$, where $N(H)$ is the normalizer of $H$ in $\pi_1(X, x_0)$.
        \end{enumerate}
        Note that if $\tilde{X}$ is a normal covering, then $G(\tilde{X}) \cong
        \pi_1(X, x_0) / H$. Furthermore, if $\tilde{X}$ is a universal covering, then
        $G(\tilde{X}) \cong \pi_1(X)$.
    \end{theorem}


    \begin{theorem}\label{th:group_quotient}
        Let $G$ be a group acting on a space $Y$, such that each $y \in Y$ has a
        neighbourhood $U$ with all possible $g(U)$ for $g \in G$ disjoint. Then, \begin{enumerate}
            \item The quotient map \[
                p\colon Y \to Y / G, \qquad y \mapsto Gy
            \] is a normal covering space.
            \item $G$ is the group of deck transformations of this covering space, if
            $Y$ is path connected.
            \item $G\cong \pi_1(Y / G) / p_*(\pi_1(Y))$ if $Y$ is path connected and
            locally path connected.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{theorem}



    \section{The hyperbolic plane}

    The upper half plane $\mathbb{H}^2 = \{(x, y) \in \R^2\colon y > 0\}$ (which can
    also be thought of as part of the complex plane), when equipped with the metric
    \[
        \frac{dx^2 + dy^2}{y^2}
    \] forms a metric space with constant negative curvature. Here, geodesics consist
    of parts of semicircular arcs whose centres lie on the $y = 0$ line, or vertical
    lines.

    Another convenient model of the hyperbolic plane, the Poincar\'e disc model, can
    be obtained from the upper half plane via the conformal transformation \[
        z \mapsto i\left(\frac{z - i}{z + i}\right).
    \] This maps $\mathbb{H}^2$ precisely onto the unit disc $\mathbb{D}^2 = \{z \in
    \C \colon |z| < 1\}$. The metric now looks like \[
        \frac{4(dx^2 + dy^2)}{(1 - x^2 - y^2)^2} \equiv
        \frac{4\:dz\,d\bar{z}}{(1 - |z|^2)^2}.
    \] Geodesics in this model are also semicircular arcs whose centres lie on the
    unit circle, or diameters of $\mathbb{D}^2$.

    Since both of these First Fundamental Forms arise from a conformal
    parametrization (the coefficients $E = G$, $F = 0$), angles in the hyperbolic
    plane (in either model) are precisely the same as the usual Euclidean angles.


    \section{Fundamental domains}

    We return to group actions on spaces; specifically, we consider discontinuous
    groups acting on a space $X$, which is either $\R^2$ or $\mathbb{D}^2$. Here, a
    group $G$ acts discontinuously on $X$ if there exists a non-empty open set
    $V\subseteq X$ such that no two distinct points $x, x' \in V$ satisfy $x' = gx$
    for some $g \in G$, i.e.\ no two points are \emph{equivalent} under $G$. We may
    further restrict our attention to groups $G$ which act as \emph{isometries} of
    the space $X$.

    We say that a non-empty connected open set $D \subseteq X$ is a fundamental
    domain for $G$ if no two distinct points in $D$ are equivalent under $G$, and
    every point in $X$ is equivalent under $G$ to some point in the closure
    $\overline{D}$.

    We are mostly interested in the case where $D$ is a polygon, i.e.\ the boundary
    $\partial D$ is a countable (preferably finite) union of \emph{sides} $s_i$, with
    only finitely many sides meeting any compact set. Each side is a non-degenerate
    (contains at least $2$ points) connected closed subset of a line. Furthermore, if
    $s_i \cap s_j \neq \emptyset$ for some $i \neq j$, then this intersection $s_i
    \cap s_j$ must be a single point $z$ called a \emph{vertex}. Here, $z$ is an
    endpoint of both $s_i$ and $s_j$. Finally, if a side $s_i$ has a finite endpoint
    $z$, then must be exactly one other side $s_j$ which also has the endpoint $z$.
    Such a domain is called a \emph{fundamental polygon} for $G$.

    \begin{example}
        Recall the action of $\Z^2$ on $\R^2$ via translations, with $(m, n) \in
        \Z^2$ sending $(x, y) \in \R^2$ to $(x + m, y + n)$. Then, the open unit
        square $(0, 1) \times (0, 1)$ is a fundamental domain for $\Z^2$. Its
        closure, the unit square $I^2 = [0, 1] \times [0, 1]$, is a fundamental
        polygon with 4 sides, four vertices.
    \end{example}
    \vspace{1em}

    \begin{lemma}
        Every discontinuous group $G$ of isometries of $\R^2$ or $\mathbb{D}^2$ has a
        fundamental polygon.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $D$ be the set of points in $\R^2$ or $\mathbb{D}$ whose distance from
        the origin $0$ is less than their distance from any other point $g(0)$, where
        $g \in G$. This must be a domain; if $x' = gx$ for some $x, x' \in D$ and $g
        \in G$, without loss of generality assume that the distance $\rho(0, x) \leq
        \rho(0, x')$. From $x' \in D$, we must have $\rho(0, x') < \rho(x', g(0)) =
        \rho(g(x), g(0)) = \rho(x, 0)$ which is a contradiction. Such a construction
        is called a Dirichlet domain, and the remaining properties can also be
        demonstrated.
    \end{proof}


    We are interested in the converse: when is a given polygon $D$ a fundamental
    polygon of a discontinuous group $G$? This is answered by Poincar\'e's classical
    theorem for fundamental polygons. First, we require some additional information
    on which sides of the polygon are equivalent. This is done via an
    \emph{identification}, where each side $s$ is assigned another side $s'$ and an
    isometry $A(s, s')$ such that \begin{itemize}
        \item[(a)] $A(s, s')$ maps $s$ onto $s'$.
        \item[(b)] $(s')' = s$ and $A(s', s) = (A(s, s'))^{-1}$.
        \item[(c)] If $s = s'$, then $A(s, s')$ is the identity on $s$.
        \item[(d)] For each side $s$, there is a neighbourhood $V$ of $s$ such that
        $A(s, s')(V \cap D) \cap D = \emptyset$.
    \end{itemize}

    These isometries $A(s, s')$ are called generators, and they generate the group
    $G$. Note that if $A(s, s')$ has order 2, it must be a reflection in the side $s
    = s'$. This gives us a \emph{reflection relation} $A^2 = 1$ for this generator.
    We will soon introduce another set of relations, called the \emph{cycle
    relations} deal with angle sum properties at the vertices.

    From $D$, we construct an \emph{identified polygon} $D^*$ by identifying the
    sides of $D$. Define the surjection $\pi\colon \overline{D} \to D^*$ where
    $\pi(x) = \pi(x')$ if there is a generator $A$ such that $x' = Ax$. For $x, x'
    \in D^*$, we now define the metric \[
        \rho^*(x, x') = \inf \sum_{i = 1}^n \rho(z_i, z_i')
    \] where $\pi(z_1) = x$, each $\pi(z_i') = \pi(z_{i + 1})$, and $\pi(z_n') = x'$.
    Note that this immediately gives \[
        \rho^*(\pi(x), \pi(x')) \leq \rho(x, x'),
    \] making $\pi\colon \overline{D} \to D^*$ a continuous map. We say that $D$ is
    \emph{complete} if \begin{itemize}
        \item[(e)] $\pi^{-1}(x)$ is finite for each $x \in D^*$, which in turn
        guarantees that $\rho^*$ is indeed a metric.
        \item[(f)] $D^*$ is complete in the metric $\rho^*$.
    \end{itemize}

    We now return to cycle relations. Let $z_i$ be a vertex of $D$, and $s_1$ be one
    of the two sides with endpoint $z_1$. This must be identified with the
    corresponding side $s_1'$ via the generator $A_1 = A(s_1, s_1')$. Set $z_2 =
    A_1(z_1)$, and let $s_2 \neq s_1'$ be the (unique) other side with endpoint
    $z_2$. Repeat the above process to obtain a sequence of pairs of sides $(s_1,
    s_1'), (s_2, s_2'), \dots$, a sequence of generators $A_1, A_2, \dots$, and a
    sequence of vertices $z_1, z_2, \dots$. Since all these vertices are related to
    $z_1$ via a product of generators, they all map to the same point in $D^*$.
    Condition $(e)$ now guarantees that this sequence of vertices must be periodic;
    since each vertex admits only two sides adjoining it, the sequence of pairs of
    sides, along with the sequence of generators must also be periodic. Set $m$ to be
    the least positive integer such that all three of these sequences have period
    $m$. We call $(z_1, z_2, \dots, z_m)$ a cycle of vertices. By setting \[
        B = A_m \circ A_{m - 1} \circ \dots \circ A_1,
    \] called the \emph{cycle transformation}, we have $Bz_1 = z_1$. Now, note that
    the images \[
        D, A_1^{-1} (D), A_1^{-1} \circ A_2^{-1} (D), \dots, A_1^{-1} \circ
        \dots \circ A_m^{-1} (D) \tag{\star}
    \] form a star shape around the vertex $z_1$ (which may not go all the way
    around). Let $\alpha(z_i)$ be the angle between sides $s_{i - 1}'$ and $s_i$ at
    the vertex $z_i$, measured from inside the polygon. To ensure that the angle sum
    in the mentioned star shape is $2\pi$, or a submultiple so that `folding' around
    $z_1$ along these images of the sides leaves no `gap' or `overlap', we impose the
    following \emph{cycle condition}. \begin{itemize}
        \item[(g)] For each cycle $(z_1, z_2, \dots, z_m)$, there exists an integer
        $\nu$ such that \[
            \nu \sum_{i = 1}^m \alpha(z_i) = 2\pi.
        \]
    \end{itemize}
    Note that the last transformation in (\star) is just $B^{-1}$. By continuing the
    process (\star) $\nu$ times, we rotate around $z_1$ by a full turn and must
    return to the original copy of $D$, thus guaranteeing that $B$ is orientation
    preserving and that $B^\nu = 1$. In other words, $m\nu$ copies of $D$ `fit'
    around the vertex $z_1$, placed there by these products of generators.  Each
    possible cycle gives us a relation of this form; these are called the \emph{cycle
    relations}.

    A polygon $D$ satisfying all of these conditions (a-g) is called a
    \emph{Poincar\'e polygon}.

    \begin{theorem}[Poincar\'e]
        Let $D$ be a Poincar\'e polygon, and let $G$ be the group generated by the
        identifying generators. Then, $G$ is discontinuous, $D$ is a fundamental
        polygon for $G$, and the cycle and reflection relations form a complete set
        of relations for $G$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        See \emph{Maskit} \cite{maskit}.
    \end{proof}

    The copies $g(D)$ for $g \in G$ are all mutually disjoint, and the copies
    $g(\overline{D})$ fill up the entirety of the space $X$, overlapping only at the
    sides. This immediately shows that $X$ is a covering space of $X/G \cong D^*$.
    When $X$ is $\R^2$ or $\mathbb{D}^2$, this is a universal cover since these
    spaces are simply connected.


    \section{Constructing $\Sigma_2$ from a fundamental polygon}

    Consider the regular octagon $D$ in $\mathbb{D}^2$ with each interior angle $2\pi
    / 8$, illustrated below. Such a shape can be constructed by first creating a
    $(\pi / 2, \pi / 8, \pi / 8)$ right triangle with one of the $\pi / 8$ angles at
    the origin, then reflecting about the side through the origin to obtain 16
    copies.  Again, such a triangle can be shown to exist, since in the hyberbolic
    plane, right triangles satisfy the rules \[
        \cos{A} = \cosh{a} \sin{B}, \qquad
        \tan{A} = \frac{\cot{B}}{\cosh{c}}.
    \] where $A, B$ are the angles apart from the right angle, and $a, c$ are the
    absolute lengths of the sides opposite $A, \pi / 2$. Thus, it is enough to draw
    two line segments starting at the origin with the appropriate lengths $a, c$
    (obtained from plugging in $A = B = \pi / 8$) at an angle $\pi / 8$ from each
    other, then draw the (unique) line joining the two endpoints.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/double_torus.png}
        \end{center}
        \caption{The identified octagonal polygon for the double torus in the
        Poincar\'e disc, and the corresponding cuts in the double torus.}
        \label{fig:double_torus}
    \end{figure}


    It is clear that with the given identification of the sides of $D$, the
    corresponding identified polygon $D^*$ is homeomorphic to $\Sigma_2$. This can
    also be shown by starting with a model of $\Sigma_2$, then introducing cuts to
    flatten it out. Since $D$ has finitely many sides, the conditions (a-g) are
    easily checked. Crucially, the cycle conditions work out because we are in the
    hyperbolic plane, where eight regular octagons can fit around a point.
    Poincar\'e's theorem now guarantees that $\mathbb{D}^2$ is indeed a universal
    cover of $\Sigma_2 \cong D^* \cong \mathbb{D}^2 / G$, where $G$ is the group
    generated by the cycle relations (there are no reflection relations here).
    Theorem.~\ref{th:group_quotient} also guarantees that the quotient map $p\colon
    \mathbb{D}^2 \to \Sigma_2$ is a normal covering space, that $G$ is the group of
    deck transformations of this covering space, and that $G \cong \pi_1(\Sigma_2)$.

    The space $\Sigma_2$ naturally inherits a differential structure from its
    universal cover $\mathbb{D}^2$; given $x \in \Sigma_2$, look at its pre-image in
    the fundamental octagon $\overline{D}$ and use the metric there. Note that there
    is no ambiguity, since the First Fundamental Form in $\mathbb{D}^2$ is identical
    for points the same distance from the origin, and $\pi^{-1}(x)$ consists of such
    radially symmetric points. Since the Poincar\'e disc has a constant negative
    curvature of $-1$, so does this model of $\Sigma_2$.


    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/van_kampen.png}
        \end{center}
        \caption{Decomposing the double torus into two sets $U$ (cyan) and $V$
        (yellow), with their intersection $U \cap V$ (green). A loop
        travelling clockwise once in the green region can be pushed outwards to the
        boundary of the octagon.}
        \label{fig:van_kampen}
    \end{figure}


    We use Van Kampen's theorem to compute the fundamental group of $\Sigma_2$, by
    considering the two indicated open sets $U, V$ in $D^*$. Note that $U$ is
    contractible to a point hence its fundamental group is trivial. The set $V$
    deformation retracts to the boundary, which when properly identified consists of
    four loops sharing a single basepoint, i.e.\ the wedge product of four copies of
    $S^1$. Thus, the fundamental group of $V$ is the free group on four generators
    $a, b, c, d$.  Now, $U \cap V$ is an annulus which deformation retracts to a
    circle, hence has fundamental group $\Z$. The generator of $\pi_1(U \cap V)$, a
    single loop around the annulus in $U \cap V$, gets retracted to the boundary when
    viewed as a loop in $V$, hence corresponds to the homotopy class
    $[aba^{-1}b^{-1}cdc^{-1}d^{-1}] \in \pi_1(V)$. This loop must also correspond to
    the identity element in $\pi_1(U) = 0$, hence we have the relation
    $aba^{-1}b^{-1}cdc^{-1}d^{-1} = e$. Thus, we have \[
        \pi_1(\Sigma_2) = \langle a, b, c, d \mid
        aba^{-1}b^{-1}cdc^{-1}d^{-1}\rangle.
    \] This is isomorphic to the group $G$, and corresponds directly to its
    generators and cycle relations.


    \section{Conclusion}

    We have seen that it is possible to equip the topological manifold $\Sigma_2$
    with a differential structure giving it constant negative curvature $-1$. This is
    consistent with the Gauus-Bonnet formula \[
        \int_{\Sigma_g} K\:dA = 2\pi\chi(\Sigma_g) = 4\pi(1 - g).
    \] Note that plugging in $g = 2$ and $K = -1$ identically tells us that the total
    surface area of this structure is $4\pi$. Now, the area of each of the hyperbolic
    $(\pi / 2, \pi / 8, \pi / 8)$ triangles in the Poincar\'e disc, used in
    Figure.~3, is equal to the angle defect \[
        \pi - \left(\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{8} + \frac{\pi}{8}\right) =
        \frac{\pi}{4}.
    \] Since 16 of them combine to form our fundamental polygon, it has a total area
    of $4\pi$, as expected.

    We also note that the surfaces $\Sigma_g$ for genus $g \geq 3$ can also be
    constructed in a similar manner, by identifying the sides of a $4g$-gon with
    interior angles $2\pi / 4g$. The identification follows the same pattern as with
    the torus and the double torus. If we denote $[ab] = aba^{-1}b^{-1}$, then the
    sequence of identifications on the sides of the $4g$-gon read in order will be of
    the form $w = [a_1b_1][a_2b_2] \dots [a_g b_g]$. The fundamental group
    $\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$ can also be deduced as before, turning out to be the free group
    on the generators $a_1, b_1, \dots, a_g, b_g$ with the word $w$ as its only
    relation.
