    \section{Signed measures}

    As a motivating example, consider the space of linear functionals on $\C^n$; each
    element of this space is a linear function $\phi\colon \C^n \to \C$. If we denote
    the standard basis of $\C^n$ by $\{e_i\}$ and its dual basis by $\{\phi_i\}$,
    any linear functional $\phi$ can be written as \[
        \phi = \sum_{i = 1}^n \phi(e_i)\, \phi_i.
    \] Now we switch to a different perspective; note that each element of $\C^n$ is
    an $n$-tuple of complex numbers of the form $(z_1, z_n, \dots, z_n)$. In other
    words, it is an assignment of complex numbers to the indices $X = \{1, 2, \dots,
    n\}$. Thus, each element of $\C^n$ can be associated with a function $f\colon X
    \to \C$, and vice versa. This gives us an identification of $\C^n$ with the space
    of functions $C(X)$ (all such functions are continuous when $X$ is equipped with
    the discrete topology). For instance, the basis vectors $\{e_i\}$ of $C(X)$ can
    now be represented by the functions \[
        e_i\colon X \to \C, \qquad j \mapsto \delta_{ij}.
    \] Now, in order to extract the `coordinates' $z_i \equiv f(i)$ from some $f \in
    C(X)$, we may define the following Dirac measures $\mu_i$ on $X$, concentrated at
    the index $i$. \[
        \mu_i\colon \mathcal{P}(X) \to C, \qquad
        E \mapsto \begin{cases}
            1, &\text{ if } i \in A, \\
            0, &\text{ otherwise}.
        \end{cases}
    \] This means that for any $f \in C(X)$, \[
        f(i) = \int f\:d\mu_i.
    \] The dual basis $\{\phi_i\}$ behaves as $\phi_i(e_j) = \delta_{ij}$, so \[
        \phi_i(f) = \phi_i\sum_{j = 1}^n f(j)\,e_j = f(i) = \int f\:d\mu_i.
    \] Thus, for any linear functional $\phi\colon C(X) \to \C$, we have \[
        \phi(f) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \phi(e_i)\, \phi_i(f) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \phi(e_i)\,
        \int f\:d\mu_i = \int f \sum_{i = 1}^n \phi(e_i)\:d\mu_i.
    \] If we could make sense of the measure $\mu$ described by \[
        \mu = \sum_{i = 1}^n \phi(e_i)\: \mu_i,
    \] then we could write \[
        \phi(f) = \int f\:d\mu.
    \] Note that the coefficients $\phi(e_i)$ are complex numbers, so $\mu$ is not
    necessarily a measure in the conventional sense!


    \subsection{Basic definitions}

    \begin{definition}
        Let $\M$ be a $\sigma$-algebra over $X$. A function $\nu\colon \M \to
        [-\infty, +\infty]$ is called a signed measure if \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\nu(\emptyset) = 0$.
            \item For all countable collections of disjoint measurable sets
            $\{E_i\}$, we have \[
                \nu\left(\bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty E_i\right) = \sum_{i = 1}^\infty
                \nu(E_i).
            \]
        \end{enumerate}
        \begin{remark}
            For disjoint sets $E, F \in \M$, we want \[
                \nu(E \cup F) = \nu(E) + \nu(F).
            \] Thus, we cannot allow the situation where $\nu(E) = +\infty$ and
            $\nu(F) = -\infty$, or vice versa.
        \end{remark}
        \begin{remark}
            Note that in condition 2, the union on the left hand side is independent
            of order, while the infinite sum on the right hand side is not. Thus, we
            demand that either the sum on the right converges absolutely, or the
            following: neither one of the sums \[
                \sum_{i: \nu(E_i) \geq 0} \nu(E_i), \qquad
                \sum_{j: \nu(E_j) < 0} \nu(E_j)
            \] should diverge to $\infty$.
        \end{remark}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{lemma}
        Let $E, F \in \M$, with $E \subseteq F$. Then, \begin{enumerate}
            \item If $|\nu(E)| < \infty$, then \[
                \nu(F\setminus E) = \nu(F) - \nu(E).
            \]
            \item If $\nu(E) = \pm\infty$, then $\nu(F) = \pm\infty$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Using $\nu(F) = \nu(F\setminus E) + \nu(E)$, we obtain \emph{1} when
        $|\nu(E)| < \infty$. Otherwise, for $\nu(E) = \infty$, we cannot have
        $\nu(F\setminus E) = \mp\infty$, hence we must have $\nu(F) = \pm \infty$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{corollary}
        If any measurable set $E\subseteq X$ has $\nu(E) = \pm\infty$, then $\nu(X) =
        \pm\infty$. This immediately shows that we cannot have two measurable sets
        $E, F \in \M$ with $\nu(E) = +\infty$, $\nu(F) = -\infty$. In other words, a
        signed measure has either of the following forms. \[
            \nu\colon \M \to [-\infty, +\infty), \quad\text{or}\quad
            \nu\colon \M \to (-\infty, +\infty].
        \]
    \end{corollary}

    \begin{example}
        Consider a non-negative measure $\mu$, and a function $f\in L^1(\mu)$. Then,
        the measure defined by \[
            \nu(E) = \int_E f\:d\mu
        \] is a (finite) signed measure.
    \end{example}
    \begin{example}
        Consider any two non-negative measures $\mu_1, \mu_2 \geq 0$. Then, the
        measure $\nu$ defined by \[
            \nu = \mu_1 - \mu_2
        \] where either one of $\mu_1, \mu_2$ is finite is a signed measure. Indeed,
        any signed measure is of this form.
    \end{example}

    \begin{lemma}[Continuity from below]
        Let $\{E_i\}$ be a collection of measurable sets such that each $E_i
        \subseteq E_{i + 1}$. Then, \[
            \lim_{n \to \infty} \nu(E_n) = \nu\left(\bigcup_{n = 1}^\infty
            E_n\right).
        \]
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{lemma}[Continuity from above]
        Let $\{E_i\}$ be a collection of measurable sets such that each $E_i
        \supseteq E_{i + 1}$, and $|\nu(E_1)| < \infty$. Then, \[
            \lim_{n \to \infty} \nu(E_n) = \nu\left(\bigcap_{n = 1}^\infty
            E_n\right).
        \]
    \end{lemma}

    \subsection{The Hahn and Jordan decomposition theorems}

    \begin{definition}
        A set $P \in \M$ is called a positive set for $\nu$ if for every measurable
        subset $E \subseteq P$, we have $\nu(E) \geq 0$.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        A set $N \in \M$ is called a negative set for $\nu$ if for every measurable
        subset $E \subseteq N$, we have $\nu(E) \leq 0$.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        A set $F \in \M$ is called a null set for $\nu$ if for every measurable
        subset $E \subseteq F$, we have $\nu(E) = 0$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{example}
        Let $\mu$ be a non-negative measure and let $f$ be a measurable function.
        Define the signed measure \[
            \nu(E) = \int_E f\:d\mu.
        \] It is clear that any measurable subset of $f^{-1}[0, \infty]$ is a
        positive set for $\nu$, any measurable subset of $f^{-1}[-\infty, 0]$ is a
        negative set for $\nu$, and any measurable subset of $f^{-1}(0)$ is a null
        set for $\nu$.
    \end{example}

    \begin{lemma}
        Every measurable subset of a positive(/negative/null) set is
        positive(/negative/null).
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $P$ be a positive set for $\nu$, and $E \subseteq P$ be a measurable
        subset. We claim that for all measurable subsets $F \subseteq E$, $\nu(F)
        \geq 0$. This is immediate from the fact that $F \subseteq E \subseteq P$ is
        a measurable subset of the positive set $P$. The cases for negative and null
        sets are analogous.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Countable unions of positive(/negative/null) sets are
        positive(/negative/null).
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $\{P_i\}$ be a countable collection of positive measurable sets, and let
        $P = \bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty P_i$. Define the sets \[
            Q_i = P_i \setminus \bigcup_{j = 1}^{i - 1} P_j,
        \] and note that $P = \bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty Q_i$, with the collection
        $\{Q_i\}$ being disjoint. Furthermore, each $Q_i \subseteq P_i$ is a positive
        set. Now for any measurable $E \subseteq P$, each $E \cap Q_i \subseteq Q_i$
        is a positive set, hence \[
            E = \bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty E \cap Q_i = \sum_{i = 1}^\infty \nu(E \cap
            Q_i) \geq 0.
        \] The cases for negative and null sets are analogous.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Let $\nu\colon \M \to [-\infty, +\infty)$ be a signed measure, and let $E \in
        \M$ such that $\nu(E) > 0$. Then, there exists a measurable subset $\tilde{E}
        \subseteq E$ such that $\tilde{E}$ is a positive set for $\nu$ and
        $\nu(\tilde{E}) > 0$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        If $E$ is a positive set, we are done. Otherwise, there exists some $F
        \subseteq E$ such that $\nu(F) < 0$. Note that \[
            \nu(E\setminus F) = \nu(E) - \nu(F) > 0.
        \] For any non-positive set $A$, define the set \[
            S_A = \{n \in \N : \nu(B) < -1 / n \text{ for some } B \subseteq A, B \in
            \M\}.
        \] When $A$ is not a positive set, $S_A$ is clearly non-empty and hence has a
        minimum element by the Well Ordering Principle.

        We have a non-positive set $E$, hence $S_E$ has a minimum element $n_1$.
        Choose $F_1 \subseteq E$ such that $\nu(F_1) < -1 / n_1$, set $E_1 =
        E\setminus F_1$, and note that \[
            \nu(E_1) = \nu(E) - \nu(F_1) > \nu(E) + \frac{1}{n_1} > 0.
        \] If $E_1$ is a positive set we are done. Otherwise, $S_{E_1}$ has a minimum
        element $n_2$, hence we can pick $F_2 \subseteq F_1$ such that $\nu(F_2) < -1
        / n_2$. Setting $E_2 = E_1\setminus F_2 = E\setminus(F_1 \cup F_2)$, we have
        \[
            \nu(E_2) = \nu(E_1) - \nu(F_2) > \nu(E) + \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} >
            0.
        \] Again, if $E_2$ is a positive set, we are done; otherwise, we refine it to
        obtain $E_3$ as before, and so on. In this manner, if at any stage the set
        $E_k = E\setminus \bigcup_{i = 1}^k F_i$ is not a positive set, we let $n_{k
        + 1}$ be the minimum element of $S_{E_k}$, pick $F_{k + 1} \subseteq E_k$
        such that $\nu(F_{k + 1}) < -1 / n_{k + 1}$, and note that \[
            \nu(E_{k + 1}) = \nu(E_k) - \nu(F_{k + 1}) > \nu(E) + \sum_{i = 1}^{k +
            1} \frac{1}{n_i} > 0.
        \] We stop this process if at any stage $E_k$ is a positive set; otherwise,
        we obtain infinite sequences of sets $\{E_i\}$ and $\{F_i\}$. Set \[
            A = E\setminus\bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty F_i = \bigcap_{i = 1}^\infty E_i.
        \] We claim that $A$ is a positive set for $\nu$. Note that the sets
        $\{F_i\}$ are all disjoint subsets of $E$, which has finite measure, hence \[
            \nu\left(\bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty F_i\right) = \sum_{i = 1}^\infty \nu(F_i)
            > -\infty.
        \] This shows that the series \[
            \sum_{i = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n_i} < -\sum_{i = 1}^\infty \nu(F_i) < \infty.
        \] For this convergence to hold, the terms $1 / n_i \to 0$, $n_i \to \infty$.
        Also note that \[
            \nu(A) = \nu(E) - \sum_{i = 1}^\infty \nu(F_i) > \nu(E) + \sum_{i = 1}
            \frac{1}{n_i} > 0.
        \] Suppose that $A$ is not positive for $\nu$. Then, $S_A$ has a minimum
        element $m$, hence we can pick $B \subseteq A$ such that $\nu(B) < -1 / m$.
        Since $n_i \to \infty$, we can fix $k$ such that $n_k > m$. But, \[
            B \subseteq A = \bigcap_{i = 1}^\infty E_i \subseteq E_k, \qquad
            \nu(B) < -\frac{1}{m} < -\frac{1}{n_k}.
        \] This contradicts the minimality of $n_k$ with respect to the set
        $S_{E_k}$. This shows that $A \subseteq E$ is indeed a positive set of
        positive measure, as desired.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}[Hahn Decomposition]\label{theorem:hahn_decomposition}
        Let $\nu$ be a signed measure on $(X, \M)$. Then, there exists a positive set
        $P$ and a negative set $N$ for $\nu$ such that $P \cup N = X$, $P \cap N =
        \emptyset$. Furthermore, if $P, N$ and $P', N'$ are two decompositions of
        $X$, then the symmetric difference $P\Delta P' = N\Delta N'$ is a null set
        for $\nu$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Without loss of generality, suppose that $\nu$ is of the form $\nu\colon \M
        \to [-\infty, +\infty)$. Let $\mathscr{P} \subseteq \M$ be the collection of
        all positive measurable sets for $\nu$. Note that this collection is
        non-empty, since $\emptyset \in \mathscr{P}$. Set \[
            m = \sup_{E \in \mathscr{P}} \nu(E).
        \] Note that from the properties of the supremum, there exists a sequence of
        sets $\{P_i\}_{i \in \N}$ from $\mathscr{P}$ such that $\nu(P_i) \to m$. Set
        $P = \bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty P_i$, and note that $P$ is a positive set for
        $\nu$, i.e.\ $P \in \mathscr{P}$. We claim that $\nu(P) = m$. To see this,
        define \[
            Q_i = \bigcup_{j = 1}^i P_i,
        \] and note that $\{Q_i\}$ is an increasing sequence of positive measurable
        sets for $\nu$. Also, each $Q_i \supseteq P_i$, so $0 \leq \nu(P_i) \leq
        \nu(Q_i) \leq m$. Taking limits, we have $\nu(Q_i) \to m$. Thus, continuity
        from below gives \[
            \nu(P) = \nu\left(\bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty Q_i\right) = \lim_{n \to \infty}
            \nu(Q_i) = m.
        \]

        Now, set $N = X\setminus P$. We claim that $N$ is a negative set for $\nu$.
        Indeed, if not, then we could find some measurable $E \subseteq N$ with
        $\nu(E) > 0$. By the previous lemma, this yields a positive set $\tilde{E}
        \subseteq E$ for $\nu$ with $\nu(\tilde{E}) > 0$. Now, $\tilde{E} \cup P$ is
        a positive set for $\nu$, i.e.\ $\tilde{E} \cup P \in \mathscr{P}$. Also,
        $\tilde{E} \cap P = \emptyset$, so \[
            \nu(\tilde{E} \cup P) = \nu(\tilde{E}) + \nu(P) > m.
        \] This contradicts the maximality of $m$.

        Thus, we have obtained a Hahn decomposition $P, N$ of $X$. If $P', N'$ is
        another Hahn decomposition of $X$, then \[
            P\Delta P = (P\setminus P') \cup (P'\setminus P) = (N^c\setminus N'^c)
            \cup (N'^c\setminus N^c) = (N'\setminus N) \cup (N\setminus N') = N\Delta
            N'.
        \] Furthermore, $P\setminus P' \subseteq P$ is a positive set for $\nu$;
        $P\setminus P' \subseteq P'^c = N'$ is also a negative set for $\nu$. This
        means that $P\setminus P'$ must be a null set for $\nu$. The same reasoning
        shows that $P'\setminus P$ is a null set for $\nu$, hence so is $P\Delta P'$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{corollary}
        Given a signed measure $\nu$ on $(X, \M)$, consider the Hahn decomposition
        $P, N$ of $X$ and define the measures $\nu^+$, $\nu^-$ as \[
            \nu^+(E) = \nu(E \cap P) \geq 0, \qquad
            \nu^-(E) = -\nu(E \cap N) \geq 0.
        \] Then, we have the decomposition of $\nu$ as the difference of the non-negative
        measures $\nu^+$, $\nu^-$ as \[
            \nu = \nu^+ - \nu^-.
        \]
    \end{corollary}

    \begin{definition}
        Let $\mu, \nu$ be two measures on $(X, \M)$. We say that $\mu$ and $\nu$ are
        mutually singular, denoted $\mu \perp \nu$, if there exists $E, F \in \M$
        such that $E \cup F = X$, $E \cap F = \emptyset$, $E$ is a null set for
        $\mu$, and $F$ is a null set for $\nu$.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{example}
        For any signed measure $\nu$, the corresponding Hahn decomposition $P, N$ of
        $X$ also gives the decomposition $\nu = \nu^+ - \nu^-$ where $\nu^+, \nu^-$
        are positive measures. Then, $\nu^+ \perp \nu^-$, with $N$ being a null set
        for $\nu^+$, $P$ for $\nu^-$.
    \end{example}

    \begin{theorem}[Jordan Decomposition]\label{theorem:jordan_decomposition}
        Let $\nu$ be a signed measure on $(X, \M)$. Then, there exist unique positive
        measures $\nu^+, \nu^-$ on $\M$ such that $\nu = \nu^+ - \nu^-$ and $\nu^+
        \perp \nu^-$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        We have already shown that every signed measure $\nu$ admits such $\nu^+,
        \nu^-$ via the Hahn decomposition $P, N$ of $X$. Thus, it is enough to show
        that if $\nu = \mu^+ - \mu^-$ for positive measures $\mu^+, \mu^-$, and
        $\mu^+\perp\mu^-$ with $E, F$ being null sets for $\mu^+, \mu^-$, then $\mu^+
        = \nu^+$ and $\mu^- = \nu^-$.

        Let $A \in \M$. Then, \[
            0 \leq \mu^+(A) = \mu^+(A \cap F) + \mu^+(A \cap E) = \mu^+(A \cap F)
        \] since $A \cap E \subseteq E$ which is a null set for $\mu^+$.
        Additionally, $A \cap F \subseteq F$ which is a null set for $\mu^-$, so \[
            0 \leq \mu^+(A \cap F) = \mu^+(A \cap F) - \mu^+(A \cap F) = \nu(A \cap
            F).
        \] This shows that every subset of $F$ has positive $\nu$-measure, i.e.\ $F$
        is a positive set for $\nu$. Similarly, \[
            0 \geq -\mu^-(A) = -\mu^-(A \cap E) = -\nu(A \cap E),
        \] which shows that $E$ is a negative set for $\nu$. Thus, $F, E$ is a Hahn
        decomposition of $X$. Theorem~\ref{theorem:hahn_decomposition} immediately
        tells us that $P\Delta F = N\Delta E$ is a null set for $\nu$. Now, \[
            \mu^+(A) = \nu(A \cap F) = \nu(A \cap F \cap P) + \nu(A \cap F \cap N),
        \] but $A \cap F \cap N \subseteq (P\cap E) \cup (F \cap N) = P\Delta F$
        which is a null set for $\nu$. Thus, \[
            \mu^+(A) = \nu(A \cap F \cap P).
        \] Using the same arguments, \[
            \nu^+(A) = \nu(A \cap P) = \nu(A \cap P \cap F) + \nu(A \cap P \cap E),
        \] but $A \cap P \cap E \subseteq (P \cap E) \cup (F \cap N) = P\Delta F$,
        hence \[
            \nu^+(A) = \nu(A \cap F \cap P) = \mu^+(A).
        \] Thus, $\nu^+ = \mu^+$. An analogous argument shows that $\nu^- = \mu^-$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{remark}
        The Hahn and Jordan decomposition theorems together give the existence of the
        decomposition of any signed measure $\nu = \nu^+ - \nu^-$ along with its
        uniqueness in a certain sense.

    \subsection{The total variation measure}

    \begin{definition}
        Let $\nu$ be a signed measure on $(X, \M)$, and let $\nu = \nu^+ - \nu^-$
        for positive measures $\nu^+, \nu^-$ with $\nu^+ \perp \nu^-$. Then, the
        total variation measure $|\nu|$ of $\nu$ is defined as \[
            |\nu| = \nu^+ + \nu^- \geq 0.
        \]
    \end{definition}

    \begin{lemma}
        Let $E \in \M$. The following are equivalent. \begin{enumerate}
            \item $E$ is a null set for $\nu$.
            \item $\nu^+(E) = \nu^-(E) = 0$.
            \item $|\nu|(E) = 0$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $P, N$ be the Hahn decomposition of $X$ associated with $\nu$.

        (\emph{1}\Rightarrow \emph{2}) Note that $E \cap N, E \cap P \subseteq E$
        are null sets for $\nu$. Thus, \begin{align*}
            \nu^+(E) &= \nu^+(E \cap P) + \nu^+(E \cap N) \\
            &= \nu^+(E \cap P) \\
            &= \nu^+(E \cap P) - \nu^-(E \cap P) \\
            &= \nu(E \cap P) \\
            &= 0.
        \end{align*}
         Similarly, \begin{align*}
            \nu^-(E) &= \nu^-(E \cap P) + \nu^-(E \cap N) \\
            &= \nu^-(E \cap N) \\
            &= -\nu^+(E \cap N) + \nu^-(E \cap N) \\
            &= -\nu(E \cap N) \\
            &= 0.
        \end{align*}

        (\emph{2}\Rightarrow \emph{3}) follows trivially.

        (\emph{3}\Rightarrow \emph{1}) By the positivity of $\nu^+, \nu^-$, we
        immediately have $\nu^+(E) = \nu^-(E) = 0$. Thus, for any measurable $F
        \subseteq E$, we have $\nu^+(F) = \nu^-(F) = 0$, hence $\nu(F) = 0$.
        Therefore, $E$ is a null set for $\nu$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Let $\nu, \mu$ be signed measures. The following are equivalent. \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\nu \perp \mu$.
            \item $\nu^+ \perp \mu$ and $\nu^- \perp \mu$
            \item $|\nu| \perp \mu$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $P, N$ be the Hahn decomposition associated with $\nu$.

        (\emph{1}\Rightarrow \emph{2}) Let $\nu \perp \mu$ via the decomposition $E,
        F$ of $X$. Then $F$ is a null set for $\nu$, $E$ for $\mu$. We claim that
        $\nu^+\perp \mu$ via the decomposition $N \cup F, P \cap E$. It is clear that
        $P \cap E \subseteq E$ is a null set for $\mu$; we now show that $N \cup F$
        is a null set for $\nu^+$, i.e.\ $\nu^+(N \cup F) = 0$. Indeed, \[
            0 \leq \nu^+(N \cup F) \leq \nu^+(N) + \nu^+(F) = \nu^+(F) = 0.
        \] We have used the fact that $N$ is a null set for $\nu^+$, and $F$ is a
        null set for $\nu$ together with the previous lemma.

        The proof that $\nu^-\perp \mu$ via the decomposition $N \cup F, P \cap E$
        is analogous.

        (\emph{2}\Rightarrow \emph{3}) Let $\nu^+\perp\mu$ via $E_1, F_1$, and
        $\nu^-\perp\mu$ via $E_2, F_2$. We claim that $|\nu| \perp \mu$ via the
        decomposition $E_1 \cup E_2, F_1 \cap F_2$. Is is clear that $E_1 \cup E_2$
        is a null set for $\mu$ since it is the union of the null sets $E_1, E_2$ for
        $\mu$. We must show that $F_1 \cap F_2$ is a null set for $|\nu|$, i.e.\
        $|\nu|(F_1 \cap F_2) = 0$; but this is clear from the fact that $F_1, F_2$
        are null sets for $\nu^+, \nu^-$, hence \[
            0 \leq |\nu|(F_1 \cap F_2) = \nu^+(F_1 \cap F_2) + \nu^-(F_1 \cap F_2)
            \leq \nu^+(F_1) + \nu^-(F_2) = 0.
        \]

        (\emph{3}\Rightarrow \emph{1}) Let $|\nu| \perp \mu$ via $E, F$. We claim
        that $\nu\perp\mu$ via the same decomposition $E, F$; indeed $|\nu|(F) = 0$
        immediately shows that $F$ is a null set for $\nu$ by the previous lemma.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Let $\nu$ be a signed measure.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\nu$ is a finite measure if and only if $|\nu|$ is a finite measure.
            \item $\nu$ is a $\sigma$-finite measure if and only if $|\nu|$ is a
            $\sigma$-finite measure.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        The finiteness of $\nu$ implies that $\nu^+$ and $\nu^-$ are finite hence
        their sum $|\nu|$ is finite, and vice versa. Next, if $X$ is a countable
        union of $\{X_i\}$ each of which has finite $\nu$-measure, each $\nu^+(X_i) <
        \infty$, $\nu^-(X_i) < \infty$ i.e.\ each $X_i$ has finite $|\nu|$-measure,
        and vice versa.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{definition}
        The space of functions $L^1(\nu)$, where $\nu$ is a signed measure, is
        defined by \[
            L^1(\nu) = L^1(\nu^+) \cap L^1(\nu^-).
        \]
    \end{definition}

    \begin{lemma}
        The spaces $L^1(\nu) = L^1(|\nu|)$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Note that \[
            \int_P |f|\:d\nu = \int_X |f|\:d\nu^+ = \int_P |f|\:d|\nu|, \qquad
            \int_N |f|\:d\nu = -\int_X |f|\:d\nu^- = -\int_N |f|\:d|\nu|. \qedhere
        \]
    \end{proof}

    \begin{definition}
        Let $\nu$ be a signed measure and $\mu$ be a positive measure. We say that
        $\nu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$, denoted $\nu\ll\mu$, if
        $\mu(E) = 0 \implies \nu(E) = 0$ where $E \in \M$.
        \begin{remark}
            If $\nu \ll \mu$, then all null sets for $\mu$ are null sets for $\nu$.
        \end{remark}
        \begin{remark}
            If $\nu \ll \mu$ and $\nu \perp \mu$, then $\nu = 0$. Indeed, if $X = E
            \cup F$, $E \cap F = 0$ with $F$ null for $\nu$, $E$ \null for $\mu$,
            then for any $A \in \M$, we have $\nu(A) = \nu(A \cap E)$. But $A \cap E
            \subseteq E$ is a null set for $\mu$, hence $\mu(A \cap E) = 0 \implies
            \nu(A) = \nu(A \cap E) = 0$.
        \end{remark}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{lemma}
        Let $\nu$ be a signed measure and let $\mu$ be a positive measure. The
        following are equivalent. \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\nu \ll \mu$.
            \item $\nu^+ \ll \mu$ and $\nu^- \ll \mu$.
            \item $|\nu| \ll \mu$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        (\emph{1}\Rightarrow \emph{2}) If $\mu(E) = 0$, then $\mu(F) = 0$ for every
        measurable $F \subseteq E$, hence $\nu(F) = 0$. In other words, $E$ is a null
        set for $\nu$, hence $\nu^+(E) = \nu^-(E) = 0$ by a previous lemma.


        (\emph{2}\Rightarrow \emph{3}) If $\mu(E) = 0$, then $\nu^+(E) = \nu^-(E) =
        0$, hence $|\nu|(E) = \nu^+(E) - \nu^-(E) = 0$.

        (\emph{3}\Rightarrow \emph{1}) If $\mu(E) = 0$, then $|\nu|(E) = 0$ hence $E$
        is a null set for $\nu$ by a previous lemma, giving $\nu(E) = 0$.
    \end{proof}
