## Partial Differential Equations

A partial differential equation typically involves a number of variables $x_1, \dots, x_n$, an unknown multivariable function $u(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ as well as its partial derivatives with respect to these variables.

$$ f\left(x_1, \dots, x_n; u_{x_1}, \dots, u_{x_n}; u_{x_1x_1} \dots, u_{x_1x_n}; \dots\right) = 0. $$

Here, we use the notation
$$ u_{x_i} = \pp{u}{x_i}, \quad u_{x_ix_j} = \pp{}{x_j}\left(\pp{u}{x_i}\right), \quad\dots.$$
We may also use Newton's notation specifically to denote derivatives with respect to time.
$$ \dot{u} = \ppt{u}, \quad \ddot{u} = \pp[2]{u}{t}, \quad\dots. $$
The special operator $\grad{} = \sum \partial/\partial{x_i}\ve{e^i}$ is often used to define the *gradient*, *divergence*, and *Laplacian*  of scalar and vector fields. Let $u(\ve{x})$ be a scalar field and $\ve{q}(\ve{x})$ be a vector field, and let $\{\ve{e^i}\}$ be our standard basis.
$$ \begin{align}
\grad{u} &= \sum_i \pp{u}{x_i} \ve{e^i}. \tag{Gradient} \\
\divg{\ve{q}} &= \sum_i \pp{q_i}{x_i}. \tag{Divergence} \\
\lapl{u} &= \sum_i \pp[2]{u}{x_i}. \tag{Laplacian}
\end{align} $$
Another quantity called the *curl* is only defined in $\R^3$ as follows.
$$ \curl{\ve{q}} = \sum_i \epsilon_{ijk}\pp{q_i}{x_j}\ve{e^k}. 
\tag{Curl} $$

### Wave Equation

$$ \ddot{u} = c^2 \nabla^2{u}. $$
In one dimension, this reduces to
$$ \pp[2]{u}{t} = c^2 \pp[2]{u}{x}. $$

A class of solutions is given by $u(x, t) = A\cos(\omega (t - x/c) + \phi)$.

### Heat Equation

$$ \ppt{T} = \alpha \lapl{T}. $$

We start with Fourier's Law, which states that the local heat flux density $\ve{q}$ is related to the gradient of the temperature as $\ve{q} = -\kappa \nabla T$. 
This means that the rate of flow of heat energy per unit area is proportional to the negative gradient of temperature locally, *i.e.* heat flows in the direction of *decreasing* temperature, proportional to the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of the material, which is a simple scalar for isotrpic materials.

The law of conservation of heat tells us that rate of change of internal heat per volume is given by $\nabla\cdot \ve{q} = -\rho\sigma\,(\partial{T}/\partial{t}) = 0$. This means that the rate of flow of heat away from a region is proportional to the rate of *decrease* in temperature of that region with time, *i.e.* loss of heat energy in a volume is directly proportional to the decrease in temperature via $Q = \rho\sigma V\Delta{T}$. Note that $\rho$ is the density of the material and $\sigma$ is its specific heat capacity.
Putting these together and using $\lapl{T} = \divg{\grad{T}}$ yields the result, with $\alpha = \kappa/\rho\sigma$.

In one dimension, this reduces to
$$ \ppt{T} = \alpha \pp[2]{T}{x}. $$

Note that for anisotropic materials, $\kappa$ is a second order tensor and hence doesn't commute with the divergence.
$$ \rho\sigma\ppt{T} = \divg{(\kappa\grad{T})}. $$
