    \section*{Assignment I}

    \problem Let $x: [-1, 1] \to \R$ be a continuous function satisfying \[
        x(t) = x(0) + \int_0^t x(s)\:ds.
    \] Show that \[
        x^2(t) = x^2(0) + 2\int_0^t x^2(s)\:ds.
    \]

    \solution Observe that $x'(t) = x(t)$, hence integrating by parts yields \[
        \int_0^t x^2(s)\:ds = \int_0^t x(s) x'(s)\:ds = x^2(s)\Big|_0^t - \int_0^t
        x(s)x'(s)\:ds,
    \] whence \[
        2\int_0^t x^2(s)\:ds = x^2(t) - x^2(0).
    \]


    \problem Consider the IVP \[
        \dot{x} = x^2 + t^2, \qquad
        x(0) = 1.
    \] Prove that for some $b > 0$, there is a solution defined on $[0, b]$. Also
    find $c > 0$ such that there is no solution on $[0, c]$.

    \solution Fix $d = 1$, $r = 1$. The map $(t, x) \mapsto x^2 + t^2$ is bounded by
    $M = 5$ on $[t_0 - d, t_0 + d] \times \overline{B_r(x_0)} = [-1, 1]\times[0, 2]$.
    Thus, Peano's Theorem guarantees a solution on the interval $[0, b]$ with $b =
    \min(c, r/M) = 1/5$.

    Note that for any solution $x$, we must have \[
        x'(t) \geq x^2(t), \qquad -\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \geq 1,
    \] whence \[
        1 - \frac{1}{x(t)} \geq t, \qquad x(t) \geq \frac{1}{1 - t}.
    \] Thus, there is no solution on $[0, 1]$.


    \problem Determine the maximal interval of existence for the following IVP. \[
        \dot{x} = y\cos^2{x} + \sin{t}\cos{y} + 1, \qquad
        \dot{y} = \sin{y} + x, \qquad
        x(0) = 0, \quad
        y(0) = 1.
    \]

    \solution Framing the system of equations as $\dot{\bm{x}} = f(t, \bm{x})$ note
    that \[
        |f(t, \bm{x})| \leq |y\cos^2{y} + \sin{t}\cos{y} + 1| + |\sin{y} + x|
        \leq |y| + |x| + 3 \leq 2|\bm{x}| + 3.
    \] Furthermore, $f$ is $C^1$; thus the maximal interval of existence for any
    solution of the given IVP is $\R$.


    \problem Maximize the interval length in the Picard-Lindel\"of Theorem for the
    solution of the IVP \[
        \dot{x} = 5 + x^2, \qquad
        x(0) = 1.
    \]

    \solution For $r > 0$, the maximum value of the map $(t, x) \mapsto 5 + x^2$ on
    $\R\times \overline{B_r(x_0)} = \R\times [1 - r, 1 + r]$ is $M = 5 + (1 + r)^2$.
    Also, \[
        |f(t, x) - f(t, y)| = |x^2 - y^2| = |x + y|\dot |x - y| \leq (2 + 2r) |x -
        y|,
    \] hence $L = (2 + 2r)$ is the Lipschitz constant for $f$. Thus, we must choose
    $h < \min(r/M, 1/L) = \min(r/(6 + 2r + r^2), 1/(2 + 2r))$. This is maximised at
    $r = \sqrt{6}$.


    \problem Show that the sequence of Picard iterates of the IVP \[
        \dot{x} = x^{1 / 3}, \qquad
        x(0) = 0
    \] converges, but the IVP does not have a unique solution.

    \solution It is clear that all Picard iterates of this IVP are identically zero,
    but we have a family of solutions $\{x_\alpha\}_{\alpha \geq 0}$ described by
    \[
            x_\alpha(t) = \begin{cases}
                0, &\text{ if } x \in [0, \alpha], \\
                k(t - \alpha)^{3 / 2}, &\text{ if } x \in [\alpha, \infty).
            \end{cases}
    \]


    \problem Let $f\colon \R \to \R$ be a continuous function, and let $x\colon I \to
    \R$ be a solution of $x' = f(x)$ for an interval $I$. Show that $x$ is a monotone
    function.

    \solution Suppose to the contrary that $x'(a) > 0$ and $x'(b) < 0$ for some $a, b
    \in I$. Without loss of generality, let $a < b$, $x(a) \leq x(b)$. Pick $\tau \in
    (a, b)$ such that $x(\tau)$ is maximum, and let $\sigma$ be the largest number in
    $[a, \tau]$ such that $x(\sigma) = x(b)$. Then, we must have all $x(t) \geq
    x(\sigma)$ for $t \in [\sigma, \tau]$, hence $x'(\sigma) \geq 0$. But, \[
        0 \leq x'(\sigma) = f(x(\sigma)) = f(x(b)) = x'(b) < 0,
    \] a contradiction.


    \problem Let $T$ be a linear operator on $\R^n$ that leaves a subspace $E
    \subseteq \R^n$ invariant. Show that $e^T$ also leaves $E$ invariant.

    \solution Note that for any $x \in \R^n$, we have \[
        e^Tx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{T^kx}{k!}.
    \] Each $T^nx \in E$, so each term in the limit is in $E$ as well. Since
    linear subspaces of $\R^n$ are closed, the limit $e^Tx \in E$.


    \problem Can the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem be applied to the sequence of functions
    $t \mapsto \sin(nt)$ on $[0, \pi]$?

    \solution No; the given family is not equicontinuous. Suppose to the contrary
    that there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|\sin(nt) - \sin(ns)| < 1/2$ for all $n
    \in \N$ whenever $|s - t| < \delta$. Then we can pick $N \in \N$ such that
    $\pi/2N < \delta$. Thus, $|\pi/2N - 0| < \delta$, but $|\sin(N\cdot\pi/2N) -
    \sin(0)| = 1 > 1/2$, a contradiction.



    \section*{Assignment III}
    \setcounter{prob}{0}

    \problem Using appropriate Lyapunov functions, discuss the stability and
    asymptotic stability of the following systems.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \[
            \dot{x} = y, \qquad
            \dot{y} = -x - y.
        \]

        \item \[
            y'' + 6y^5 = 0.
        \]
    \end{enumerate}

    \solution \begin{enumerate}
        \item This system has an equilibrium point at $(0, 0)$. Consider $V(x, y) =
        x^2 + y^2$; then, $V(0, 0) = 0$, $V(x, y) > 0$ on $\R^2\setminus\{(0, 0)\}$,
        and \[
            \dot{V} = 2x\dot{x} + 2y\dot{y} = -2y^2.
        \] Since $\dot{V}(x, y) \leq 0$, the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$ is stable.
        Furthermore, $(0, 0)$ is asymptotically stable.

        \item Rewrite this system as \[
            y_1' = y_2, \qquad y_2' = -6y_1^5.
        \] This system has an equilibrium point at $(0, 0)$. Consider \[
            V(y_1, y_2) = \frac{1}{2}y_2^2 + \int_0^{y_1} 6s^5 \:ds =
            \frac{1}{2}y_2^2 + y_1^6.
        \] Then, $V(0, 0) = 0$, $V(y_1, y_2) > 0$ on $\R^2\setminus\{(0, 0)\}$, and
        \[
            \dot{V} = y_2\cdot 6y_1^5 - 6y_1^5 \cdot y_2 = 0.
        \] Thus, $(0, 0)$ is stable. Since every flow line must stay trapped on the
        surface $V(y_1, y_2) = 0$, the point $(0, 0)$ is not asymptotically stable.
    \end{enumerate}


    \problem Check whether solutions of the following equations have infinitely many
    zeros on $(0, \infty)$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $y'' + (\sin^2{x} + 1)y = 0$.
        \item $y'' - x^2y = 0$.
        \item $xy'' + y = 0$.
    \end{enumerate}

    \solution \begin{enumerate}
        \item Use Sturm's Comparison Theorem against \[
            u'' + u = 0,
        \] whose solutions have infinitely many zeros on $(0, \infty)$.

        \item If a non-trivial solution of $y'' - x^2y = 0$ would have admitted
        infinitely many zeros on $(0, \infty)$, so would a non-trivial solution of
        $u'' = 0$, a contradiction.

        \item On each interval$(0, K^2)$, the given equation $y'' + y / x = 0$ is a
        Sturm majorant of $u'' + u / K^2 = 0$, which admits non-trivial solutions of
        such as $u(x) = \sin(x / K)$. This admits zeros at each $nK\pi$, as long as
        $0 < nK\pi < K^2$, i.e.\ at least $\lfloor K/\pi\rfloor$ zeros. Thus,
        non-trivial solutions of $y'' + y / x$ admit at least $\lfloor K/\pi\rfloor +
        1$ roots on $(0, K^2)$. Since $K$ is arbitrary, such $y$ admit infinitely
        many roots.
    \end{enumerate}


    \problem Construct a Green's function for the differential operator $d^2/dx^2$
    under the boundary condition $u(0) = u(1) = 0$.

    Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[0, 1]$. Show that the function \[
        u\colon [0, 1] \to \R, \qquad
        x \mapsto \int_0^1 G(x, \xi) f(\xi) \:d\xi
    \] satisfies \[
        u'' = f, \qquad
        u(0) = u(1) = 0.
    \]

    \solution Note that $u'' = 0$ admits two linearly independent solutions $y_1(x) =
    x$, $y_2(x) = 1 - x$ with $B_0y_1 = 0$, $B_1y_2 = 0$. Thus, a Green's function
    for $u'' = 0$ is of the form \[
        G(x, \xi) = \begin{cases}
            \xi(1 - x) / c, &\text{ if } 0 \leq \xi \leq x, \\
            x(1 - \xi) / c, &\text{ if } x \leq \xi \leq 1.
        \end{cases}
    \] Indeed, $c = W'(y_1, y_2) = -1$, so \[
        G(x, \xi) = \begin{cases}
            -\xi(1 - x), &\text{ if } 0 \leq \xi \leq x, \\
            -x(1 - \xi), &\text{ if } x \leq \xi \leq 1.
        \end{cases}
    \]

    Check that \begin{align*}
        u(x) &= \int_0^x -\xi(1 - x) f(\xi) \:d\xi +
            \int_x^1 -x(1 - \xi) f(\xi) \:d\xi \\
        u'(x) &= \int_0^x\xi f(\xi)\:d\xi - (1 - x) x f(x) -
            \int_x^1 (1 - \xi) f(\xi) \:d\xi + x(1 - x) f(x) \\
        &= \int_0^1 \xi f(\xi)\:d\xi - \int_x^1 f(\xi)\:d\xi \\
        u''(x) &= f(x).
    \end{align*}


    \problem Let $\lambda$ and a non-zero function $u$ satisfy the following
    equation. \[
        u'' + \sin(x) u + \lambda u = 0, \qquad
        u(-1) = u(1) = 0.
    \] Show that $\lambda \geq -1$.

    \solution Suppose that $\lambda < -1$ admits a non-trivial solution $u$. Then, a
    Sturm majorant of the given problem is $v'' = 0$, hence any non-trivial solution
    $v$ ought to admit a zero in $(-1, 1)$. However, one can choose solutions $v$
    without roots in $(-1, 1)$, say $v = x + 2$, a contradiction.
