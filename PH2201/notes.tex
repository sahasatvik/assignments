    \section{Introduction}
    The quantum world differs from the classical world in many aspects, most of
    which we seldom encounter in our daily lives and are hence unintuitive.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The physical world is not deterministic; uncertainty is
        intrinsic to the quantum world.
        This is sometimes illustrated by the Schr\"odinger's cat thought
        experiment.
        \item Both light and matter exhibit characteristics of waves as well
        as those of particles.
        However, a single object cannot exhibit both of these properties 
        simultaneously.
        \item Physical quantities may be quantized -- they may be
        constrained to have discrete values rather than vary continuously.
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Duality of light}
    \subsection{Blackbody radiation}
    A blackbody is an object which absorbs all radiation incident on it, and
    reflects none. It also emits radiation of all frequencies.

    Kirchoff's Law says that the rates of emission and absorption of radiation of a
    body in thermal equilibrium will be equal. By thermal equilibrium, we mean that
    the temperatures of the body and its surroundings are equal.

    \begin{theorem}[Stefan-Boltzmann Law]
        The power emitted by a blackbody is given by \[
            P \,=\, \sigma A T^4.
        \]
        Here, $\sigma \approx 
        \SI{5.67e-8}{\joule\second^{-1}\meter^{-2}\kelvin^{-4}}$ is called the
        Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
    \end{theorem}

    We may break down the total energy density $\rho \propto T^4$ in terms of the
    contributions from each frequency, so \[
        \rho = \int_0^\infty \rho(\nu) \:d\nu.
    \] 
    It turns out that $\rho(\nu)$ is non-monotonic. This cannot be explained by
    classical mechanics (Rayleigh-Jean's Law), which predicts that $\rho(\nu)$
    is unbounded with increasing frequency -- the famous ultraviolet catastrophe.

    \begin{theorem}[Wien's Law]
        The positions of the peaks in $\rho(\nu)$ are described by \[
            \lambda_{peak} \,=\, \frac{w}{T}.
        \]
        Here, $w \approx \SI{2.9e-3}{\milli\kelvin}$.  
    \end{theorem}
    Note that at $T \approx \SI{300}{\kelvin}$, the peak wavelength $\lambda_{peak}$
    is in the infrared range: this is why night vision googles are useful.
    
    Consider a collection of electromagnetic waves in a blackbody cavity, with
    temperature $T$. This can be seen as the superposition of normal modes.
    The classical approach to the blackbody problem is to suppose that the energy
    density at a particular frequency is given by \[
        \rho(\nu) = \overline{E} n(\nu),
    \] where $n(\nu)$ is the number density of wave modes with frequency $\nu$, and
    $E$ is the average energy of the radiation.

    The classical law of equipartition of energy gives \[
        \overline{E} = k_B T,
    \] where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

    The wavenumber of for modes within the cavity is given by \[
        \ve{k} = \frac{2\pi}{L}\ve{n},
    \] where $\ve{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ with integral components. Now, \[
        \nu = \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{c}{L}n.
    \] Treating $n$ as a continuous variable and using $dV = 4\pi n^:dn$, we write
    \[
        n(\nu)\:d\nu = \frac{8\pi}{c^3}\nu^2\:d\nu.
    \] This leads to the Rayleigh-Jean Law,
    \begin{boxedeq*}
        \rho(\nu)\:d\nu = \overline{E} n(\nu) \:d\nu 
            = \frac{8\pi k_B T}{c^3}\nu^2\:d\nu.
    \end{boxedeq*}\\~\\

    Planck looked at the probability distribution for the energy, \[
        P(E) = \frac{1}{k_B T}e^{-E /k_B T}.
    \] This is the Boltzmann distribution. It can be shown that \[
        \overline{E} = \frac{\int_0^\infty E P(E) \:dE}{\int_0^\infty P(E) \: dE} 
        = k_B T,
    \] which recovers the Rayleigh-Jean Law.

    Planck's idea was to restrict $E$ to discrete values; integral multiples of the
    frequency $\nu$. This leads to \[
        \overline{E} = \frac{\sum E P(E)}{\sum P(E)} 
            = \frac{h\nu}{e^{h\nu /k_B T} - 1}.
    \] 
    This gives us the Planck distribution.

    \begin{theorem}[Planck's Law]
        The spectral energy density of radiation emitted by a blackbody in thermal
        equilibrium is described by the distribution \[
            \rho(\nu)\:d\nu 
                = \frac{8\pi h}{c^3} \frac{\nu^3}{e^{h\nu /k_B T} - 1} \:d\nu.
        \] 
        Here, $h \approx \SI{6.626e-34}{\joule\second}$ is called Planck's constant.
    \end{theorem}
    When $h\nu \ll 1$, we recover the Rayleigh-Jean limit. When $h\nu \gg 1$, we get
    the Wien limit.

    Now we calculate, \[
        \rho = \int_0^\infty \rho(\nu)\:d\nu = \frac{8\pi^5k_B^4}{15c^3h^3}T^4,
    \] which recovers the Stefan-Boltzmann Law with \[
        \sigma \,=\, \frac{2\pi^5k_B^4}{15c^2h^3}.
    \] 
    Also, the maxima of the Planck distribution recovers Wien's Law, with \[
        \nu_{max} \,\approx\, 2.8 \frac{k_B T}{h}.
    \] 

    \subsection{Photoelectric effect}
    This reveals the dual nature of light. Classical optics relies on the wave
    nature of light, thus explaining phenomena such as interference and diffraction.
    This culminates in Maxwell's equations, which predict the wave nature of light
    as the propagation of oscillating electric and magnetic fields.

    The photoelectric effect in the phenomenon in which light shining on a metal
    surface ejects electrons from it, thus producing a current. Suppose that the
    incident light has frequency $\nu$, intensity $I$ and this produces a current
    $i$. We can calculate the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons
    $E_{max} = eV_0$ by adjusting an opposing potential $V$.

    It turns out that for a constant intensity $I$, the photocurrent saturates at
    the same value. However, different frequencies $\nu$ produces different stopping
    potentials $V_0$; the greater the frequency, the greater the magnitude of the
    stopping potential. This turns out to have a linear relationship, with
    \begin{boxedeq*}
        E_{max} \,=\, eV_0 \,=\, h(\nu - \nu_0) \,=\, h\nu - \phi.
    \end{boxedeq*}
    The slope $h$ is universal for all metals, while $\phi = h\nu_0$ varies
    between different metals.
    This shows that below a certain frequency $\nu_0$, we obtain no photocurrent,
    regardless of the intensity! This appears strange from a classical perspective,
    where the energy delivered by an electromagnetic wave is related to its
    intensity, not its frequency.

    Einstein proposed that light strikes the metal in bundles of energy, all
    integral multiples of $h\nu$. There is also a minimum binding energy which must
    be overcome to liberate electrons from the metal surface -- this cannot be paid
    in a continuous manner, since any partial energy given to an electron will be
    lost before the arrival of the next energy bundle. Thus, each energy bundle must
    carry a minimum energy $h\nu_0$ in order to liberate electrons and produce a
    photocurrent.

    This establishes a particle-like mature of light. Each energy bundle, or
    particle of light, is called a photon.

    \section{Duality of matter}
    \subsection{Matter waves}
    Louis de Broglie further hypothesised that matter also has a wave nature, with
    an associated wavelength of 
    \begin{boxedeq*}
        \lambda_{matter} \,=\, \frac{h}{p}.
    \end{boxedeq*}
    This has been demonstrated by Davisson and Germer, where a stream of electrons
    exhibits diffraction.
    
    This has some amazing implications. In the classical world, knowledge of a
    particle's position and momentum is enough to pinpoint its trajectory with
    arbitrary precision. However, the wavelike nature of matter would imply that we
    can no longer talk of a definite, localized position when we have knowledge of
    the particle's momentum! This uncertainty is inherent to quantum mechanics.

    Another consequence is the phenomenon of quantum tunnelling.

    \subsection{Double slit experiment with pellets}
    Consider Young's double slit experiment, this time with pellets sprayed from a
    gun at a wall with two slits. The other sides has a collector, which is
    moveable. Assume that the pellets do not break, and that they arrive in groups
    independent of the rate of firing. We want to find the probability that a pellet
    lands at a distance $x$ from the centre of the screen.

    Now, this just means that we have to count the number of pellets which reach the
    detector in a given time interval. Also, we expect that the probability
    distribution for two slits ought to be the sum of the distributions for the
    individual slits, obtained by closing one slit at a time. The distribution for a
    single slit looks something like a Gaussian, so their combination should also
    look like a broad Gaussian.

    Note that this says nothing about phenomena such as interference.

    \subsection{Double slit experiment with electrons}
    Instead of using pellets, we now use electrons. These can be fired by heating
    a tungsten wire inside a box with a pinhole. Suppose that the detector at the
    other side produces a `click' whenever an electron strikes it; all such clicks
    are identical and random. The electrons are also fired very slowly, so that
    there is only one electron passing through the slits and hitting the screen at a
    given time. This means that we hear distinct, separate clicks at random
    intervals, which means that an electron must have passed through one of the
    slits at random before impacting the screen.

    What we observe is that over a long time, the probability distribution of the
    electrons is in the form of an interference pattern, just like with light waves.
    The strange thing is that if each electron passes through one slit at a time,
    the other slit ought to be `closed' from its perspective, which means that we
    ought to have obtained the superposition of two Gaussians!
    
    An attempt to explain this might be that the electrons follow some complex
    pathways incorporating both slits. On the other hand, the probability observed
    at the centre is greater than the sum of the probabilities for the single slits,
    and there are regions of zero probability on the screen where the single slit
    probabilities would suggest finite values. This would imply that closing a slit
    somehow increases the probabilities in one region and decreases that in another.

    Thus, the electrons arrive at the screen as particles, but their distribution on
    the screen shows interference patterns just like those of a wave!
    
    % \subsubsection{Spying on the electrons}
    % Suppose that we repeat this experiment, but this time we place a detector on the
    % slits. Thus, we can be sure which slit a given electron passes through.
